So some others may have arrangements, which allows them more volume than \npotentially what allows us. So that's the reason you will see higher sales and contribution for \nsome others versus us. \n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\n \n \n Cipla Limited \n \n \nMay 12, 2023 \n \nPage 11 of 19"

And once that level is hit, then I think \nit will slowly, over a period of the next 2, 3 years, graduate towards the company average."

I think on the other question that you raised on \nAlbuterol as you told, the market is constantly growing. There is one category which is \nconstantly growing in the U.S., and we hope to participate in the growth there."

It's not going to be \n-- because it's a B2 product. So I think it will be a gradual rise. I think we're slightly better than \nwhat we thought we'd do. And our objective is to keep it -- so I don't think it will be -- we're not \nsuddenly going to increase share in this category, but over a -- a share increase will be there"

The first is we are \nseeing a pretty strong Tier 2 to 6 growth, and that is feeding some of our products that are in the \nareas of respiratory and anti-infectives because those are the type of products that will deepen \nin India.

That's one. I think to your \nother question, yes, it could very well have been something that we could have thought of earlier. \nBut generally, what happens is when your file is under active review, and scientific-based \nquestions are not closed, that is not the time that you introduce a new facility because it creates \nmore comp"

So while we expand people in India, the lead lag impact is almost 6, 9 \nmonths. So we put people from the time they start becoming productive, it's a 6-, 9-month story, \nright?

So I think we went back at that point \nin time, and we reconfigured our strategy to say that even if we acquire an asset, which is in late \nclinics, we must have our own pipeline to add to it.  \nAnd the time distance between -- I mean, the time difference between when our pipeline comes \nto market and when we add an in-licensed assets shou"

If you look at the overall share that we have, there's still \nscope to increase the therapies and geographically as well.

So you really want big brand franchisees that you can create which is when we turn our \nthinking into trying to improve the margins by doing the brands ourselves. So it's a mix of both. \nIf we are getting a brand that is relatively smaller then the interest to create because then the \ninterest to take the low margin doesn't make sense.
