      "content": "Thank you, Naveen and good evening to all of you. Welcome to our earnings call for third quarter of fiscal 2018. I hope you had received the investor presentation that we have posted on our website. I will now take you through some of the key themes which are emerging from our financials of this quarter. Firstly, on the revenue trajectory, the results of the quarter you may have seen demonstrated very strong momentum across our businesses in India, South Africa, API, Europe and Sub Saharan Africa markets. On the core margins and the quality of earnings, this quarter they reflect improved mix and continued focus on the cost optimization. During this quarter, our core margins expanded by about 230 basis points on a year-on-year basis associated with gross margin expansion and very consistent year-on-year decline across employee and other expenses. Thirdly on the balance sheet health side, it has been improving consistently. Our efforts have benefited in keeping working capital investments under check and the tapering down of capital expenditure. As a result, free cash flows are strong and have increased by about 56% sequentially and 29% on a year-on-year basis. The net debt-to-equity ratio has improved to 0.13 as at December from 0.20 as at March 2017. Net debt to EBITDA also declined from 0.92 at the beginning of the quarter to about 0.68 at the end of this quarter. Fourthly on the tax side, you need to consider couple of adjustments which I will explain in the balance of the call to get to the effective tax rate for the year, which is in line with what we have communicated which is about 25%. Overall income from the operation stands at about 3,914 crores which indicate year-on-year growth of 7%. If you adjust it for the impact of GST classification, the normalized overall company level revenue growth is about 10%. Gross margin after material cost is about 65%. It improved over 300 basis points sequentially in line with the February 07, 2018 comments that we made in the last quarter call. This was on the expected lines and is a result of better geographic mix and product mix at the overall company level. As it is usual to see in the quarter 4, the next quarter ending March 2018, considering seasonality and the geographical mix, we are likely to see some moderations in the gross margins. During the quarter, we also maintained strong control on the spends with total expenses which include employee cost and all other expenses at about 1,717 crores, they declined marginally on a sequential basis. The employee cost for the quarter stood at about 657 crores. The other expenses for this quarter which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion expenses, they were about 1,059 crores. They declined marginally on a sequential basis. Total R&D investments for this quarter are 7.6% of revenues, they are up as we are targeting by about 150 basis points. The increase was driven by clinical trial charges among others. With all this, reported EBITDA for the quarter is about 819 crores or 20.9% of revenue. This is an increase of about 21% on a year-on-year basis. You would notice an increase in the depreciation and amortization line which is on account of a drop in the value of our acquired intangible asset for the US generics market due to the evolving pricing environment and delay in launching some of the products. The overall impact of this net of tax is about $27 million. Tax charge for the quarter is negative due to the fact that the deferred tax balances for US business have been suitably adjusted to give effect to the applicable tax rates in the US, post the tax reform. The full year ETR adjusted for these one-offs continues to be around 25%. The reported profit of the tax is about 401 crores which is 10.2% of sales. As mentioned earlier, if you adjust the PAT for the quarter because of the one-offs related to change in tax rate as well as the impairment of intangibles, the YoY growth is about 25%. Free cash flow after CAPEX for the quarter is about 482 crores. In this quarter, we have invested 142 cores on the capital expenditure which is lower compared to our historical trend and in line with our overall intent of tapering down the capital expenditure. Our long-term debt remains at USD 550 million which was mainly used to fund Invagen acquisition. We also have working capital loan of about USD 107 million which act as natural hedge towards our receivables. Outstanding forward contract as a hedge for receivables as of December 2017 is USD 61 million and South African Rand 750 million. During the quarter, we have also hedged the certain portion of our forecasted export revenues and the outstanding forward contracts as cash flow hedge as of 31st December is USD 56 million and Rand 125 million. With this, now I would request to invite Umang to present the business and operational performance. He is joining from another location over phone line.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. We are progressing quite well on our key priorities for the year. Our key markets continue to deliver strong growth. India business delivered an exceptional growth during the quarter of 22%, when adjusted for GST with both prescription and generic businesses delivering healthy growth. South Africa, API, Europe and Sub-Saharan African markets continued the strong momentum. This quarter we saw the approval and launch of our much- awaited limited competition products, Budesonide and Decitabine. We also launched Sevelamer. However, the pricing in the market has not resulted in the sales uptick so far. We have contracted February 07, 2018 a fair share in these products already and we will see ramp up in coming quarters. You would have also seen an announcement of the approval of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate which is generic for Viread. We are targeting to maintain the launch trajectory in the US for the good mix of differentiated products. We remain committed towards establishing a regulated market respiratory franchise and have achieved significant milestones during the quarter in this journey. Happy to share that on generic Advair, we have commenced trials and will soon be dosing in patients. We are also targeting initiation of two more clinical trials for the US in the coming quarters. In Europe, we have expanded our respiratory franchise with the approval of Beclomethasone in UK, we will be the first generic player in the market. We expect to file over 10 products in quarter 4 for the US FDA taking our financial year filing count to over 20 ANDAs. Our manufacturing and R&D sites remain in a state of compliance and control. For the quarterly performance of the total revenue of 3,914 crores, 42% was contributed by the domestic business and 56% by the international business and the rest was operating income. I will now take you through our business performance starting with our India business. We had a very strong quarter with the overall business growing at 15% year-on-year on a reported basis and 22% when adjusted for GST. Going forward, the growth may get moderated marginally as we saw some element of inventory buildup during the quarter, taking our overall inventory days to a normalized level now. During the quarter, Cipla outperformed the market with 12% versus the market growth of 10% and increased market share by 10 basis points to 5.3% as per the IMS in quarter 3 FY18.Key TAs delivered above market performance including our cardiac segment which grew at 12% versus the market of 7%, anti-infectives which grew 14% versus 11% and respiratory which grew 14% versus the market at 12%. Derma also grew higher than market. As you are aware, we have been focusing on leveraging our commercial strength to partner with various MNCs. In the 9 months period so far, we have already launched 6 in-licensed products. Our North America business had sales of 100 million and moderately lower than what we had expected. Current quarter numbers do not factor much contribution from the recent launches as those are in the process of getting ramped up. Our contracted shares look healthy and we are excited to build a stronger trajectory in the coming quarters. Having said that, we are taking a deeper look into our marketed portfolio at the margin level and the relative burden on our manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure to see whether we need to intervene and rationalize a few of our selling products. The idea is to build a US business with a healthy profitability profile.Coming to the market performance as per IMS MAT December 17, Cipla is the market leader in 13 out of the 48 marketed products. We are in the top-3 position for 65% of our portfolio. Cipla has been consistently ranked among the top 10 most dispensed generic companies in the US. During the quarter, we have filed two new products and are on target to file over 20 ANDAs in the financial year. As of December 17, we have a total of 94 ANDAs pending for final approval including 27 with tentative approvals. Of these 98, 68 are Cipla/Invagen ANDAs, 11 are partnered and 15 are filed under PEPFAR. February 07, 2018 The SAGA region, which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Cipla Global Access businesses recorded growth of 11% for quarter 3 on a year-on-year basis when reported in US dollars, impacted favorably by the strengthening of the ZAR-USD versus last year. Our South Africa business delivered yet another record quarter of highest ever quarterly sales of Rand 1.09 billion which translates into 7% growth for quarter 3 versus last year. As per IMS MAT December 17, Cipla grew ahead of the market at 11.1% in the private market versus 10.3% market growth and maintained its position as the fourth largest pharmaceutical company and third position when tender businesses are included. Our partnering effort saw a significant boost in business development agenda with the Anmarate acquisition and a deal with iNova, leading to new launches in South Africa market. During the quarter, we also concluded a deal with Adcock Ingram to commercialize the comprehensive over-the-counter portfolio in Uganda and expand our footprint in Sub Saharan Africa. Our global access business degrew 13% over last year during the quarter due to tender phasing and challenges in the funding environment. We are increasingly focusing on increasing the access to affordable care in various parts of Africa through global access and our Ugandan subsidiary. QCIL which is an Uganda subsidiary recorded a growth of 59% year-on-year and had its highest ever quarterly sales in quarter 3 driven by strong tender delivery. Our Europe business continues to show strong performance with quarterly sales up 19% year- on-year basis. We are expanding our respiratory franchise and we received approval for Beclomethasone as we mentioned earlier. We are on track to launch the product through our front end and will be the first generic player in the market. In emerging markets outside Africa, quarterly sales degrew marginally on a year-to-year basis in dollar terms. The quarter was challenging given the geopolitical uncertainties in several Middle Eastern markets. On the upside, we continue to gain traction on the FPSM launch in Australia and are looking to increase our market share in the coming financial year. We are working on strengthening our business development efforts across these markets to drive future growth. Our R&D investments are focused towards building a strong growth platform for the US. Amongst the top 50 R&D projects, we are working on 16 Para IV filings in the area of respiratory, oncology and dermatology. These also include 15 plus limited competition opportunity. As alluded to in our earlier calls, we are committed to building a strong specialty portfolio for US. We at this stage are sharing details only about our phase 1 Tizanidine patch and that is progressing smoothly. We are evaluating multiple assets with some in advanced stages of discussion in Neurology and Respiratory. I would like to thank you for your attention and request the moderator to open the session for Q&A. February 07, 2018",

      "content": "Yes, certainly. So I will speak to the two questions and then Kedar can answer the question on the margins. So in terms of trajectory, I just like to say that I can’t give you any specific numbers, but I do believe that this trajectory should begin to improve quite dramatically from where we are now. I think you are right, we are at about a 100 million and over the call, we have reiterated that we tried to absorb as much of price erosion from whatever we were trying to bring to the market and I think as limited competition opportunities open up, we should be able to show growth over the 100 million trajectory. So I think good reference points would be what happens in the next 2 quarters or 3 quarters as these launches come up. On generic Advair, I think at least what we have heard from the FDAs largely around discussion that you have before you initiate a trial. I think those discussions we have been having with, and at the same time I would also like to add that very often in these trials, you sometimes realize that that your pilot studies had some issues and then you have to go back and redo them which is what we are hearing some of our competitors having and the trials are not slam dunk. It is lot of effort. I believe that about 15 to 18 months away from filing.",

      "content": "Thank you, Ananth and good evening to all of you. Welcome to our earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. I hope you have received the ‘Investor Presentation’ that we have posted on the website. August 8, 2018 I will now take you through the financials for the quarter. Let me start with the core business margins. In terms of the quality of earnings, driven by the strong performance in our home markets of India and South Africa, combined with the contribution from API business, which operates at a very healthy EBITDA margin, the consolidated EBITDA for the quarter is expanded about 18.4% to sales, an increase of over 330 basis points over the sequential quarter of Q4 fiscal ‘18, this was planned and in line with our expectations. For the quarter, overall income from operations stands at Rs.3,939 crores which recorded year-on-year growth of 12% on GST impacted base of Q1 last year. As mentioned earlier, the growth was driven by India, South Africa and API, which was partly offset by challenges in other parts of the business, such as our Global Access business and Europe. Gross margin after material cost stood at 64% for the quarter. This reflects the number of factors: Positive one being currency, adverse being A) Chinese sourcing, commodities, and oil price linked material cost inflation; B) Overhead charge due to inventory reduction; and C) Certain one-off write-off which we have taken in this quarter. We note that pricing pressures in our tender business is getting accentuated because of this cost inflation. During the quarter, we maintained tight control on expenses. Total expenses which include employee cost and other expenses stood at about Rs.1,789 crores, declined marginally on a sequential basis. Employee cost for this quarter stood at Rs.714 crores, an increase of about 2% on a sequential basis, largely due to annual increments. The other expenses for the quarter which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion expenses, stood at Rs.1,075 crores, decreasing 3% on a sequential basis. Total R&D investment for this quarter stands at 7% of revenues. We expect this to be ramped up in coming quarter in line with the progress on the generic Advair trials and other programs for the US market. EBITDA for the quarter stands at Rs.726 crores or 18.4% to sales. This is in line with our efforts to ensure year- on-year EBITDA margin improvement. Tax charge for the quarter stood at about Rs.174 crores. We are looking at full year effective tax rate of about 28%. Profit after tax stood at Rs.451 crores, impacted positively by the second tranche of the divestment proceeds of Rs.85 crores recorded in other income with respect to our stake in Chase Pharmaceuticals which is working on development of an Alzheimer drug.Although deals like this in specialty area part over routine business operations, they have booked in other income line below EBITDA due to the nature of the income being sale of equity stake. Till date we have received about Rs.245 crores from this particular divestment. Our long-term debt remains at USD 550 million, which was mainly used to fund the InvaGen acquisition. We also have working capital loans of about USD 61 million which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Total net debt-to-equity ratio is 0.13. Outstanding forward contract as a hedge for receivables as of 30th June are USD 126 million and ZAR 865 million. During the quarter we have also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. The outstanding forward contract as cash flow is as of 30th June are USD 131 million. I would now like to invite Umang to present the business and operational performance. August 8, 2018",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. I am happy to report that our quarterly operational performance was in line with our expectations and we performed well against our key priorities. Our key priorities were around India business growth, US differentiated launches, respiratory franchise in the US, South Africa growth, emerging markets biosimilar, filing trajectory and quality focus, I will talk through each one of them shortly. On our India business growth, our India business delivered healthy 22% year-on-year growth with both prescription and generic businesses growing strongly. As you are aware, the Q1 FY18 numbers were impacted due to GST led destocking in the channel and the impact of the field force transformation. We also strengthened our portfolio further with the partnership with Eli Lilly for launching BASAGLAR which is the insulin glargine injection in India. US differentiated launches: We are happy to report that against the guidance of one limited competition product launch every quarter, we are already tracking ahead with seven overall approvals in Q1 including two limited competition approvals -- Isoproterenol and Testosterone. We are already noticing early signals of revenue build up on these products which has helped us improve our DTM business gross margins. We recently announced the approval of Diclofenac as well. We maintain our guidance of unlimited competition launch for quarter and are excited about our pipeline products coming up for approvals. With respect to the respiratory franchise in the US, we are happy to announce that we have successfully completed the pivotal trials for generic Advair and are initiating clinical trial recruitments. In South Africa, we continued a strong performance in the market with the business growing over double the market growth of 15%. In the emerging markets, biosimilar partnering franchise we had good momentum and we are happy to announce that we have signed a deal on Trastuzumab for Australia, Columbia and Malaysia. We are maintaining a strong filing rate with five new fillings in Q1 and are tracking healthy against a target of 20 plus filings for the full year and we continue to operate our facilities with highest level of compliance and control. As a closure for both Goa, Indore and InvaGen we received the EIR for all the plants. I will now talk to you through the business performance starting with our India business. As alluded to earlier, India business recorded strong year-on-year growth of 22% on previous year GST impacted base. Key therapeutic areas delivered above market performance which includes cardiac, respiratory and urology. Most of these therapy areas, we have grown by almost 2% to 3% points above the market growth. Our top brands continue to outperform the market; 16 out of our top 23 brands grew higher than market. Our key respiratory brands Foracort, Seroflo and Duolin feature amongst the top 50 brands in the industry. We also entered into strategic partnership with Roche strengthening our oncology portfolio with the launch of three monoclonal antibodies. We also expanded our diabetes franchise by partnering with Eli Lilly to market and distribute insulin glargine. August 8, 2018 As you know India Q2 growth is heavily dependent on the anti-infective seasonal push. We are continuing to monitor the situation as it unfolds, but the season seems to be a little delayed compared to the earlier years. Our North America business delivered sales of 100 million, in line with the same quarter last year and lower by 5% versus the last quarter. As I alluded in the last quarterly call, the supply disruptions continued to impact the quarter, but are resolved fully and completely behind us now. Also, we continue driving value play in the US market through rationalization of select low margin SKU categories, which also impacted the recorded sales in this quarter. Having said that the sales from new products including Budesonide, Decitabine, Palonosetron and Isoproterenol contribute 30% to our DTM revenues and help deliver 300 basis points in overall DTM gross margins. This is on expected lines as we move towards the healthier product mix in the US with the ramp up of new launches and rationalization of low margin SKUs. We continue to maintain our guidance of one limited competition launch for quarter. The SAGA region which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Cipla Global Access recorded a growth of 7% year-on-year basis when reported in USD. Our South Africa business delivered yet another strong quarter recording 14% growth when adjusted for animal health for Q1. As per the IMS MAT South Africa business grew at more than double the market growth at 15% in the private market. We will soon be launching the first biosimilar Filgrastim injection from our alliance with Teva. The South African business got a significant OTC boost with the acquisition which is pending competition commission approval, of Mirren, which is an OTC portfolio present in South Africa. The acquired business has been growing over 25% in an OTC segment and is growing 300 basis points higher than market. As part of this acquisition we will get access to four key OTC brands in the cough and cold and supplement segment. We see significant synergies with the acquired business and now have access to a local manufacturing facility as well. Our Europe business declined during the quarter largely behind run offs in the same quarter of the previous year. Having said that the business continues to operate on healthy margins now. We have now taken various initiatives to improve traction on FPSM in the UK market and several other respiratory products. In emerging markets outside Africa, quarterly sales declined marginally. We are happy to announce that we have received the pharma status for our plant in Morocco, expanding our presence in Columbia we launched five new products during the quarter. We also launched Dymista in New Zealand. Our flagship program in specialty Tizanidine patch for the management of spasticity is progressing well. We are also exploring injectable formulations for several products for epilepsy indications that are in discussions with FDA for the development strategy. The company is August 8, 2018 evaluating several opportunities in the CNS space and other areas linked to movement disorders as well as in respiratory with the focus to service unmet patient needs. To close, we had a good quarter with significant progress on our key priorities. In the coming quarters our focus will remain on development of generic Advair, driving profitable growth in the US through continued focus on the limited competition launches, maintaining India performance strategy and working towards the closure of the Mirren acquisition to drive the OTC expansion in South Africa and establishing our in-license biosimilar franchise in emerging markets. We are also seeing some challenges in various parts of the businesses due to cost escalations linked to China sourced materials, the commodity cycle and the oil price hike. We are working towards mitigating these challenges through various efficiency and strategic initiatives. The Global Access business has been under pressure for some time largely behind the challenges in the funding environment and continued pricing pressure on key molecules. Despite the rebasing of the CGA business, we have been able to drive growth at an overall corporate level. I would like to thank you for your attention and will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

So, in terms of the margin movement, the impact of inflation because of China sourcing and commodities and oil, etc., is about 30 to 40 basis points of sales. In addition to that we also seen certain overhead charge because of the inventory reduction and there have been certain one-off write-offs. So, this partly impacted but going forward in the long-term I would like to believe our margins will stay in this range unless we get really high margin product opportunities for the US. So, in the near-term, I would like to believe margins would stay in the current range.",

So, therefore it has an impact on the top line but not so much on the bottom line. Coming to India business growth, I think your first question, normalized growth for a full year will not be more than 12- 14% which is going to be higher than industry but that is where the overall growth for the year will be and you are right, Q2 will show subdued growth because of the base of the previous year, because of the opening up of GST. So, our business fundamentals will be on track but I think because the base effect of this quarter will bring growth down a bit.",

Dacogen has been launched but Dacogen has to open up because when contracts open up in the market. As and when the GPOs begin to tender, then that is the time we will build for Dacogen. So, I do not think that has linked so much to supply. Last quarter we had some issue of supply but that is not the major constitute of Dacogen thing. Dacogen is a gradual progression to when the contracts open up. The supply disruptions are largely from the InvaGen side, not from India. The other thing that is happening since you raised this on the US, Cipla’s earlier business model was completely B2B in the US, we used to partner with companies and they used to sell now. Of late we have done our own filings and our B2B trajectory is coming down slowly. As a result of that, I think you will find that the overall income will start going up now. If you look at our recent launches show that 30% of our revenues are coming from DTM from the new launches that we have launched in the last 12-months. So, the traction for new product launches is there, we have had supply challenges and I believe we have reached the floor in terms of the US earnings or the US potential for sales. August 8, 2018",

I think we have signed, we are completing the metric for some of our key markets like Australia, New Zealand, Colombia and Malaysia. We have relatively deep presence here and we are going to impact with the launch of biosimilars here as well as in Algeria and Morocco. I think each product if I was to look at depending on the type of product, we are the first and alone has the potential in each country to add almost $3 to $5 million worth of annual sales and in some markets it could be a lot higher than that, so some markets we could be adding almost up to 10 million of incremental sales depending on the products. So, it is related to the timing of entry and everything else but look at our emerging August 8, 2018 markets base today, we do about $70 million of emerging market sales. So, even if we get two biosimilar products in some markets, we are almost talking about 10-12% uplift but I think that will come only after a little bit period of time, it is not immediate and imminent, but we will start getting this into our portfolio next year onwards.",

So, that indicator is growing for us, Nitin. These are all high margin launches. We also in Slide #7 in the investor deck you can see that the margin improvement because of this percentage contribution improving is quite healthy. So, to answer your question, it is very clear headroom for us, given where we are today, I think headroom to improve our US footprint is very high. So, we are not going to give any guidance in terms of percentage growth but trajectory is improving, you will see it every quarter henceforth.",

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen and good evening to all of you. Best wishes for Diwali festivities to all of you and hope you get to enjoy the week ahead with family and friends. Welcome to our earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. I hope you have received the investor presentation that we have posted on the website. Let me start with an overview of our performance in the first half of the year and certain initiatives which we have taken over the last 2 years. The quarter 2 reported performance has year-on-year comparability issues due to the higher base of last year across almost every market. This quarter, we also faced certain internal and external challenges which we will talk about in the call later. Having said that, we are tracking healthy in the first half with key businesses continuing to stay strong. India business maintained its trajectory growing 9% and 13% when adjusted for GST in the first half. South Africa continued its strong private market performance. Substantial improvement in the in-market performance was visible across our DTM markets, in emerging markets and the ramp up of the US sales driven by key new launches. November 05, 2018 Over the last 2 years, we also saw significant gross margin improvement across our businesses of India, both prescription and generic business; South Africa, again both private and tender segments; Europe, emerging market and the US DTM business largely due to portfolio momentum and cost optimization along with some marginal benefit on pricing. While this help support margin expansion and growth, we also saw the decline in the US B2B segment, Invagen performance dilution due to the price erosion and the rebasing of our global access business little bit diluting the numbers. I also wanted to clarify the impact of the recent currency movement on our performance. While rupee depreciation shows up on the topline a bit, overall benefit in the EBITDA line is hardly anything since we are not as dollarized as some of our competitors. In fact, when considered with the impact of commodity and crude price inflation and the escalation in China source supplies, the overall benefit is quite negligible. With that, let me take up the financials for this quarter. For the quarter, overall revenues from operations are at 4,012 crores. On the first half, it is 7,951 crores, recording year-on-year growth of 5%. As mentioned earlier, the growth was driven by India, South Africa and build- up of the US DTM business with new launches. This was partly offset by challenges in the other parts of the business, such as our global access business and Europe. Gross margin of the material cost stood at 64.8% for the quarter. This reflects the positive impact due to currency partly offset by the impact of commodities inflation in China. During the quarter, we maintained tight control on the spends. Total spends which include employee cost and other expenses stood at 1898 crores, increasing 6% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for this quarter stood at Rs. 712 crores, flat on a sequential basis. Other expenses for this quarter which includes R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales and distribution expenses stood at 1185 crores, increasing 10% on a sequential basis. This increase is largely attributable to sales linked cost in certain markets. Investments towards therapy-shaping initiatives such as our flagship inhalation awareness campaign, Berok Zindagi and ANDA filings. Total R&D investments for this quarter stood at 8% of revenue. This ramp up is on expected lines as we progress on our key assets. EBITDA for the quarter stands at Rs. 753 crores which is 18.8% to sales. If you try to link this up with the SEBI financials that we have published to the stock exchanges, you would have to take into account certain costs which have been factored in the OpEx and R&D line for which we have got a reimbursement in the other income. So, we have given a PBT to EBITDA bridge for your reference. Tax charge for the quarter stood at Rs. 142 crores. We are tracking at a full year effective tax rate of 28%. Profit after tax stood at Rs. 377 crores. You would recollect over the last 8 quarters, there has been a significant focus on cash generation and this includes taking various strategic decisions including closing open litigations, divestment of certain noncore businesses such as animal health, fructify certain past investments, such as our stake sale in the Chase Pharmaceutical, monetization of the domain ANDA and other dossiers, successful IPO of our Ugandan subsidiary, CiplaQCIL on the Uganda stock exchange and things like that. All these November 05, 2018 efforts have cumulatively added over Rs. 800 crores in the last 8 quarters. We will continue to retain this focus as we progress. Our long-term debt now stands at US $575 million. We also have working capital loans of about $60 million, which act as marginal hedge towards our receivables. Total net debt to equity ratio stands at 0.15. Outstanding forward contract as hedge for receivables as of 30th September are US $123 million and South Africa in the rand 855 million. They have also hedged certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. The outstanding forward contract as cash flow hedges as of 30th September is US $131 million. I am also pleased to share that India ratings have continued to affirm Cipla’s Long-term Issuer Rating at IND AAA with a stable outlook. With this, I would now like to invite Umang to present the business and operational performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. I wish all of you very happy Diwali. For us, this quarter was modest in terms of both sales and profits. Very clearly, we see three factors that have played out. The first factor, just from a year-on-year comparison, you would note that last year’s GST led restocking in both quarter 2 and quarter 3 means, we have a much higher base for domestic businesses apart from a higher base in API. Also last year, we had a strong season that had set in relatively early compared to this year where the acute season is actually only set in the last month of last quarter. This alone is a significant driver of our performance in this quarter versus the previous year’s quarter. Secondly, a couple of external headwinds came together in the form of commodity pricing and Forex as well as uncertainty around the funded environment of our global tenders. This has created a more competitive scenario and has constrained performance for the tender markets across the world. Thirdly, we have got some work to do internally from a capacity and serviceability point of view. I think we could have done better here to ensure continued supplies to our global markets and we are realizing that we are losing value on some of these which in the coming months will be fixed. Among these challenges, I am happy to note the continued momentum in our businesses. Let me begin with an update of our key priorities. On growth across markets, our private market growth across market segments remains very strong both in India, South Africa, emerging markets and US. In India, our business continues to deliver market-beating growth with strong performance across therapies. While we are actively rebalancing our acute portfolio, our chronic therapies have significantly outperformed the market growing over 21% versus the 17% market growth as per IMS in Q2. We continued a strong performance in South African private market with the business growing over double the market growth rate at 14%. In emerging markets, our key DTMs delivered double digit healthy in-market growth. We had a good momentum in our biosimilar franchise development and we are happy to announce that we have signed a deal on Bevacizumab for Sri Lanka and Nepal. For our US businesses, we are pleased that the business now started seeing a quarter-on- quarter growth of 8% versus the previous quarter with the business delivering 108 million in this quarter. We are happy to report that against the guidance of one limited competition product launch every quarter, we are already tracking ahead. The quarter saw the approval of 7 new products including key ones such as Diclofenac gel, Albendazole and Atazanavir. November 05, 2018 Recently, we also announced the approval of Metoprolol, yet another limited competition asset for the year. On profitability, as our growth trajectory remains healthy, our profitability metrics continue to remain strong. In our US business specifically, we are noticing early signs of revenue build up on new launches which has helped us improve our DTM business gross margins significantly. We have chosen to play our market sustainably and our plan is to make our businesses more sustainable by focusing on our base DTM and B2B businesses along with responsible tendering. As a result of this factor and the uncertainty around the global funded environment, our CGA business is down 54% and the South Africa tender business is down 20%. Despite this, our profitability held up during the period despite R&D peaking at 8% versus approximately 6.5% in the previous year. In terms of quality and compliance, we continued to operate our facilities with the highest level of compliance and control. During the quarter, we had audits at our Goa and Medispray facility. I am happy to share that the Medispray audit got completed without any 483s. We had two procedural observations in Goa. We have responded to the FDA and are confident that these will not have an impact on our operations. I will now take you through a more detailed business performance starting with our India business. Our India business remained largely flat for the quarter on a year-on-year basis due to the higher base of last year and the late onset of season in the current year. On a half one basis, the business delivered a healthy growth of 9% year-on-year with both prescription and generic businesses growing strongly. When adjusted for the impact of GST, the half-one growth stands at 13%. As per IMS Q2, Cipla continued its outperformance growing by 14% versus the 13% market growth. Over years, we have continued our number one position in respiratory, urology and antivirals. Key therapeutic areas delivered above market performance. Cipla gained rank in Cardiology and now stands at the fourth position growing 500 basis points higher than the market at 19%. We also continued our leadership position in Respiratory with significant outperformance versus the market at 23%. Our Berok Zindagi campaign launched during the quarter is turning out to be a benchmark therapy-shaping initiative to build public awareness about the important topic of inhaler usage. In our quarter 4 FY18 earnings call, we had guided for FY19 sales in India at US $1 billion. Currency has moved much higher than our budgeted rate of 64; however, we are targeting to reach 6400 crores including our RX, GX and consumer healthcare business in the current year. Our North America business delivered sales of 108 million, growing 12% year-on-year. As alluded to in earlier call, the US business is undergoing a change in mix as designed with the B2B business coming down sharply as no new products are getting added and the portfolio rationalization that we had initiated. These are impacting the reported sales for the US business as the new DTM product sales increase which is 40% of the Q2 DTM revenues were November 05, 2018 contributed by new products launched in the last 12 months. This has helped us drive significant margin improvement in our DTM business in line with our internal estimates. We maintained a strong filing rate with 5 new filings in quarter 2 taking the half-one count to 10 against a full year target of 20 plus filings. The SAGA region which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Cipla Global Access businesses declined 25% year-on-year in quarter 2 when reported in US dollars, largely behind the rebasing of the CGA business and the slower offtake in Sub-Saharan Africa and the lower tender sales in South Africa. Our South Africa business delivered yet another quarter of ZAR 1+ billion sales with private market business growing at 14.2% on a year-on-year basis. As per IMS MAT August 18, our South Africa business grew at almost thrice the market growth at 14% in the private market. As per YTD August IMS data, Cipla became the third largest pharma company in the South Africa private market with the 6.3% share. Our Europe business declined by 14% on a year-on-year basis during the quarter, largely behind supply issues related to certain products and milestone payments in the previous year on account of the FPSM launch. We are working towards structurally resolving these backend issues to ensure our critical products are available for servicing. In emerging markets outside Africa, quarterly sales were roughly flattish and declined marginally due to some one-offs in the previous year. We are very excited about a biosimilar franchise in the emerging markets as we move closer to signing multiple deals. We also inaugurated our manufacturing facility in Morocco during this quarter. As we end the quarter 3 and quarter 4, I am excited to see that our momentum in our private market businesses will continue but there are also external headwinds that will impact our reported performance in the short term. These involve items around the continuing commodity and China pricing related issues. The rebasing of the funded environment led business which is the tenders and other businesses in the HIV and malarial segment and the impact of sanctions in some of our markets, which will either come up as tradebarrier or against countries which will face issues in terms of currency and volatility. Despite these challenges, we will continue to invest in the health of our business and expect our momentum to continue. Our R&D investments are already higher by a percentage versus the previous year and our portfolio is skewing nicely towards more limited competition assets and inhalers. We are tracking well on a target of 1 inhaler launch per year starting next year and one limited competition launch in the US every quarter. We are continuing to invest in our quality systems and maintaining a strong state of control and compliance at our plants. We are also engaged in building our capacity sustainably and balancing it for the long term especially with regards to our sterile portfolio. This activity may take us 2 to 3 quarters and we are working on it in earnest. We have also invested a fair amount of our bandwidth in the previous 2 or 3 quarters November 05, 2018 in evaluating multiple assets in the specialty space. We are in advance stages of discussion on some interesting 505(b)(2) assets in the institutional business space. For the next 2 to 3 quarters, our quarterly profits may not see a materially significant change from this quarter. Considering our long-term aspirations, we are preparing for the next stage and positioning our business for sustainable and profitable growth. Thank you and with this, I would like to thank you for your attention and request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

Global Access has been pretty much continuing. I think we have a priority there to strengthen the portfolio because current portfolio is pretty commoditized and emerging market country specific, we sensed certain pressure, so that’s how it is played out. We won’t want to give at this stage how it could decline further, but I think we are happy that the private market segments across the markets are looking healthy.

We look at our business in the case of InvaGen, we look at our business in terms of the DTM launches that we are doing and we look at our B2B business. So, what we found is that on the DTM November 05, 2018 launches, we are possibly about 95, within 95% of our targets. It is not that we are much behind, so I think what we are selecting, launching and this is showing up in the margin pull through. On our B2B business, we have declined a lot faster than we thought we would and the impact for that has come larger and actually in some way that is linked to the general price deflationary impact in the US because when the partner sees the price decline of 15%, we get a large share of that as well. So, I think in the B2B side, we have seen a fairly significant decline possibly more than what we had anticipated and also a large chunk of our supplies also link to this B2B section. Supply related issue was linked to our B2B section in the US, so we have seen a much higher decline in the B2B. On the InvaGen side, frankly we are now stable. We are not seeing the type of decline or anything else. I think we are stable with our business. Quite largely, the portfolio substitution which is happening, so the delta that we are possibly seeing on the DTM is much higher than the 8 million that you are seeing aggregated because the 8 million had captured the fair amount of B2B that has declined within those numbers.",

So, I think if you could refer to page 3 of our press release, we have given a bridge from PBT to EBITDA and 753 crores which is about 18.8% for this quarter. That is the percentage of EBITDA which we believe is recurring percentage for this particular quarter. You would also note that multiple companies include finance income, investment income and some of the divestiture related income in their definition of EBITDA and Forex as well. We don’t consider that. About 82 crores of all these incomes because of all this 3, 4 reasons that I said, we have excluded from EBITDA. Similarly, this number was about 170 crores in first quarter, even that has been taken out. So, we are at about 18.8% for this quarter, 18.4 for the first quarter.",

It doesn’t mean that we can’t be marginally lower than that and right now, we have faced with multiple headwinds and the tender, if you just try and understand the tender side of our business, we are losing almost 100, 120 million on a full-year basis because of this and there is an impact on profitability with it.",

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen, and good evening to all of you. Welcome to our Earnings Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2019. I hope you have received the ‘Investor Presentation’ that we have posted on our website. Let me start with an overview of our quarterly performance: Our Q3 performance was on expected lines as the challenges that we alluded to in our last quarterly call played out. This quarter saw the full impact of normalization of our business in Middle Eastern markets and the rebasing of tender business in the Global Access Business. The internal challenges which we referred to in our last call they are being addressed on war-footing and they are in advanced stages of getting resolved. During the quarter we saw strong performance in select lines of businesses across our focused markets. While the high base effect for India business creates comparability issues for primary sales booked in the financials, we are happy to report very strong traction on the secondary sales accompanied by increase in market share for the quarter to about 5.4% as per the IQVIA Report. February 6, 2019 South Africa private business continued to drive strong momentum growing almost 4x the market as per market data. The US business saw strong sequential and year-on-year growth on the back of scale up of new launches. As we enter FY20, we believe some of these challenges will subside and hence our overall outlook continues to remain optimistic. With that let me take up the financials for the quarter. For the quarter, overall revenues from operations stands at Rs.4,008 crores, on nine months revenue from operations is that Rs.11,958 crores, which recorded year-on-year growth of 4%. As mentioned earlier, the growth was driven by buildup of the US DTM business with new launches which was offset by challenges in other parts of the business such as emerging markets and Global Access tenders. Gross margin after material cost stood at 64% for the quarter. The quarter’s gross margin numbers are impacted by certain one-time low margin kind of business sales in South Africa and for liquidation of inventories thereby avoiding hit in coming quarters. During the quarter we continue to maintain tight control on expenses. Total expenses which include employee cost and other expenses stood at Rs.1,837, crores declining 3% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for this quarter stood at Rs.718 crores, flattish on a sequential basis. Other expenses which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion expenses stood at Rs.1,119 crores, declining 6% on a sequential basis. Total R&D investment for this quarter stood at 7.5% of revenues. This is on expected lines as we progress on our key US assets as well as the Advair clinical trial program. With all this, EBITDA for the quarter stands at Rs.720 crores, which is about 18% of sales. Tax charge for the quarter is Rs.126 crores, we are tracking at a full year effective tax rate of 28% and profit after tax is at Rs.332 crores, which is about 8.3% of sales. As you are aware for the last two years we have focused on cash generation. Our efforts in this direction includes taking various strategic decisions including closing and settling open litigations, divesting non-core businesses, ensuring that past investments are fructified through IPO or other means and monetization of dormant ANDAs, dossiers and intellectual property. Our long-term debt remains at USD 577 million which was mainly used to fund the InvaGen acquisition. We also have working capital loans of about $60 million which act as natural hedge towards our receivables. Total net debt-equity is quite healthy at 0.14. Outstanding forward contracts as a hedge for receivables as of 31st December 2018 are USD 43 million and RAND 396 million. During the quarter we also hedged certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. The outstanding forward contract as cash flow hedges as of 31st December 2018 include USD 208 million and RAND 175 million. With this, I would like to invite Umang to present the Business and Operational Performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. Welcome to everyone on the call. Let me start with the key highlights for the quarter: The US business continued its strong trajectory, growing 18% year-on-year and 10% sequentially. We maintained a strong quality and compliance record with inspections across Kurkumbh, InvaGen which ended in minor and procedural observations. We have already received EIR for InvaGen. For the recently concluded USFDA PAI and GMP inspection at Goa we have received some observations which we deem procedural, which we submit our response February 6, 2019 to the observations within the stipulated time. Our R&D pipeline is progressing as per plan. Our respiratory trial program is on track and we are expecting to file two products next year and have one launch every year starting next year. As you would have seen, we recently announced the approval of Medroxyprogesterone injectable and we are tracking well on our guidance of one limited competition asset per for quarter. The quarter delivered continued growth across our branded markets though reported numbers are lower for some of our private market businesses. As per IQVIA Q3’19 our India business grew 12% year-on-year versus market growth of 10%. In South Africa our private business grew thrice the market at 9% as per IQVIA MAT December ‘18. Our emerging markets Biosimilar franchise is continuing to expand and we have signed new deals on Bevacizumab and Trastuzumab for multiple markets. From last quarter’s call, you would note that this quarter played out as expected and per our commentary to you in the last call. We believe we are bottoming out and crossing over the period where high based levels in the previous year due to GST one-off resulted in subdued performance. The current quarter and YTD numbers represent multiple headwinds as I explain below, most of which will probably be non-existence post the end of Q4. Over the large base of Q2 and Q3 our India business stayed largely flat with the strong prescription growth and improvement in market share. We now look forward to coming back to double-digit rates in the quarters ahead. Also post GST, the India trade had de-stocked significantly and our YTD numbers almost include the impact of nearly six days of lower primary sales. With the lower crude and stabilization of China commodities, procurement costs have now reached a point where they are beginning to abate. The current quarter includes the full impact of normalization of the Middle East business. Our commitment to the patients in these countries stay solid and we will continue to examine avenues to show continued business. For the South Africa tender and CGA, the CGA component has completely rebased and South Africa will rebase in the next two to three quarters. There is growth in our private market in South Africa and other sectors which can absorb this reset as the new tender with the three year clock sets in. Quarter numbers are soft considering certain one-time low margin sales both for SA and CGA tender business which ensure the liquidation of inventories to avoid the subsequent hit. At a company level the impact from these sales is almost 150 basis of sales in gross margin. Let me move to the Quarterly Performance now. In India reported numbers are largely flat year- on-year due to the one-time restocking impact in Q3 FY18 and destocking this year in trade. Adjusted for this, the reported growth would be 6%. We are also noticing trends of inventory February 6, 2019 normalization in certain pockets. Having said that we remain optimistic of our growth in India in Q4 and expected to be strong on year-on-year basis despite the seasonality kicking in. Our efforts on prescription generation and therapy focus have resulted in strong market share improvement across our key therapies from Q1 to Q3 of ‘19. Respiratory Inhalation market improved by over 200 basis points, Urology improved by 30 basis and Cardiology by another 30 basis. We are pleased to note that the Chronic segment is increasingly becoming the growth driver for business. In Q3 as per IQVIA, Cipla gained the rank to become the #2 Chronic segment in India, growing 19% versus the market growth of 13%. 15 Cipla brands of the top-22 brands that feature among the top 300 of the IPM have outpaced the IPM growth in Q3 FY19. We are happy to report that the award winning BerokZindagi Campaign has become a benchmark initiative to build public awareness. We are on track to achieve our target of Rs.6,300 to Rs.6,400 crores in the domestic business which includes branded, trade generics and the Consumer Healthcare business. For the US, we are happy to report that in the second quarter in a row, our US business delivered both sequential and year-on-year growth. The business grew 18% year-on-year to 118 million despite a heavily moderated contribution from the B2B segment which is only at 10% of the total sales of the US business now. I am also pleased to report the North America business reported a positive post R&D EBITDA during the quarter and is poised to scale up further in the coming quarters. This was driven by improvement in gross margins as our DTM launches scaled up. We continue to maintain our exit guidance rate of 120 to 125 million. We also continue to do well on our guidance of one limited competition launch every quarter and maintain this as we progress. We are progressing well on our trials and targeting to file two respiratory products in the US, and have one launch every year starting with the next year. The SAGA region which include South Africa, Sub-Saharan and Cipla Global Access business declined 20% year-on-year in Q3 when reported in US dollars largely behind the rebasing of the CGA business which de-grew 48% in the quarter in line with our commentary in the last quarter. Our South Africa private market continued its strong trajectory going 4x the market at 9.1% as per IQVIA MAT December ‘18. We believe our private market business in South Africa remains fundamentally strong to consistently drive growth in the future. During this quarter, the South Africa tender business has seen some softness as we referred to earlier. As the new SA tender sets up, our private market will absorb this impact. The emerging markets business declined 19% on a sequential basis largely attributable to the higher shipments made in last quarter before certain sanctions were expected to set in. In line with our strategy to consolidate our base, we divested our French-West Africa business. As alluded to earlier we believe the impact of the emerging markets uncertainties and sanctions February 6, 2019 have largely played out. We continue to maintain a good momentum in expanding a biosimilar franchise in emerging markets. On the Specialty business, we expanded our portfolio in the CNS base by signing a deal with Concert Pharmaceuticals for an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize novel GABA alpha receptor subtype selective modulator. Based on Concert’s initial preclinical and clinical evaluation, Cipla intends to develop 354 for the treatment of spasticity movement disorders. The product will have strong commercial synergies with our existing pipeline product of the Tizanidine batch. To close, we believe the challenges we referred to in the last quarterly call have played out and our business is bottoming out and has surpassed the high base effect of Q2 and Q3. So overall while this financial year has been challenging operationally, we remain bullish as we enter FY20. While India seasonality will hit in Q4 we target double-digit growth in the quarter. In the US, we remain focused driving to the 120 to 125 million sales trajectory level for Q4. With several limited competition approvals like Budesonide, Diclofenac, Isoproterenol and Metoprolol we now have a proven track record of getting strong and differentiated approvals in the US. We have indicated the launch of one differentiated product and delivered on that. Recently we also saw approval of Medroxyprogesterone, a limited competition asset for us. South Africa private market business including the Mirren OTC portfolio will continue to significantly outperform the market as the South Africa tender resets. On the operational side, we have made very good progress towards capacity debottlenecking for some of our key impacted products we have significantly improved throughputs to ensure our teams across businesses can fulfill orders and build inventory. There has also been a strong focus on de-risking important products with alternate sites and plans. We have continued to maintain a strong pipeline of launches across markets including roughly about 150 to 200 million in the NPV of US launches and we have continued to operate facilities with the highest level of compliance and control. I would like to thank you for your attention and I will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

So some people will leave, some people will come, Ananth also joined just six months back, so I think the people who come new bring new thinking, new perspectives, new energy and help us reset where the business is. As far for myself, I am very much here and looking forward to the next couple of years of strong growth, next couple of years of repositioning Cipla to be an innovation company. So right now there is no truth to any of the rumor and we are all very much here, the management team is very committed to building Cipla to a greater future.",

So, the fall in the market has been because companies have not been allowed to pass on these prices which is why start of the year it is about 8% or 9% ending the year at about 1% to 2% for the market growth. I think what is happening now is those prices are getting reset again for the next year and I think the market should hopefully start picking up growth going forward. But despite this Cipla’s performance has being very strong; we have actually grown almost 3, 4x market for the past three to four quarters because of our execution and which is why we feel strong about the private market being able to offset the tender outcome that we are seeing in the next year.

And you would have noticed that between March to September most of that increase has happened. Between September to December we have been largely flattish.

So if you analyze either YoY or sequential numbers, there is a compression in gross margin and that we referred to some of the ratios in the tender part of the side partially. I think expenditure is in control, be it people cost or other expenses. The compression on the gross margin side has led to this and you always see this operating leverage playing out, the sort of decline in EBITDA usually is much higher than the decline in sales. So increase in EBITDA is also higher than increase in sales. So, I think probably this is the quarter where negative leverage has played out along with its gross margin pressure.",

I hope you have received the investor presentation that we have posted on our website. Overall, for the financial year despite challenges in the first half, we had a strong second half and are entering FY20 on an optimistic note. We are happy to see that our focus markets have performed in line with our expectations and guidance. EBITDA margins expanded by 700 bps in quarter 4 versus last year and by about 80 basis points in the full year,.Our profit after-tax for the full year also increased by 8% despite higher tax incidence in the year. FY19 was an extremely successful year with many firsts in Ciplas growth story. To highlight a few: In India, we launched one of the largest consumers awareness campaign, called as, Berok Zindagi for respiratory, which is a therapy which continues to be our biggest growth driver. We also significantly ramped up our specialty portfolio with in-licensed offerings in diabetology, cardiology and womens health. Recently, we also launched Synchrobreathe and Niveoli as novel offerings in the respiratory. May 22, 2019 To build a specialty business in U.S. as our second engine, the year saw our largest speciality deals with a proposed acquisition to Avenue Therapeutics. This business will continue to see traction as we progress and will have its own capital requirements. Adding our first respiratory specialty asset, we have licensed Pulmazole, which is an inhaled Itraconazole solution. On the generic side, we significantly ramped up our market share in differentiated product categories and IP-enabled products. In South Africa, we expanded our OTC offerings with the acquisition of Mirren. The acquisition has given us access to a high growth portfolio with strong synergies with our existing commercial infrastructure. We also became the third largest pharma company in the private market in South Africa. As you are aware, in Uganda, we concluded the IPO of the subsidiary on the Ugandan Stock Exchange. To go beyond the pill and help patients manage their conditions better, we invested towards establishing a digital footprint. In India, we invested in Wellthy along with a commercial partnership to expand our offerings in diabetology and cardiology. In South Africa, we invested in Brandmed and acquired 30% stake to provide connected health solutions to the patients. Coming to the quarterly and full year results: The quarter overall revenues from operations are Rs 4,404 crores, which registered a growth of 19% on a year-on-year basis. The quarter saw all our businesses performing in line with our guidance. India business grew by 11% on Y-o-Y basis and U.S. business saw significant ramp up, driven by the launch of cinacalcet and grew 41% year-on-year and 38% on a quarter-on- quarter. When normalized for the contribution from cinacalcet, the U.S. business trajectory was quite in line with our expected exit run rate as guided in the last call. We also saw strong growth in the Europe and API businesses during the quarter. On a full year, the revenue from the operations are at Rs 16,362 crores, which grew by 8% on a year-on-year basis, supported by strong growth across focused markets. This is despite the fact that we saw significant rebasing in the tender side of the business, challenges in the Middle Eastern markets and certain supply challenges throughout the year. Gross margin after material cost stood at 66.3% for the quarter, which increased by 300 basis points on a sequential basis and 200 basis points on Y-o-Y basis. The expansions in the quarters gross margins are driven by contribution from the U.S. launches we alluded to earlier. For the full year, the gross margin stood at 65% marginally higher of fiscal 18. For the quarter, total expenses, which include employee costs and other expenses, stood at Rs. 1957 crores, increasing 7% on a sequential basis. The employee cost for the quarter stood at Rs. 712 crores, declined marginally on a sequential basis. Other expenses, which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion expense stood at 1245 crores, increasing May 22, 2019 11% on a sequential basis. This increase was largely driven by our growth investments in branded markets and clinical trial expenses. Total R&D expenses are at 7.1% of revenue. It is on expected lines as we progress on our key assets and as Advair clinical trials progress. EBITDA for the quarter stands at Rs. 972 crores or 22.1% to sales. During the quarter, these margins expanded by 700 bps and 75% on an absolute terms. For the full year, we saw an expansion of EBITDA margin by 80 bps. A part of this expansion has come on the back of new launches this quarter, which may not sustain fully going forward and hence we would like you to be aware of possible moderation. At the same time, this quarter includes certain litigation and provisions linked to delayed receivables and other spends in toto of approximately Rs. 50 crores over the usual baseline. Adjusted for this benefit, on a sustainable basis, the EBITDA has shown a very strong double- digit growth versus last year and at our base levels, despite seasonality in the current quarter. You would have noticed an increase in the amortization and impairment line. There is a noncash impairment adjustment of Rs. 206 crores pertaining to our U.S. business. There is a corresponding release in the tax line because of this item. Tax charge for the quarter stood at Rs. 128 crores. For the full year, ETR is at 27%. Profit after tax for the quarter is Rs. 367 crores or 8.3% of sales, which is an increase of 106% over last year. For the full year, profit after tax increased by 8% to Rs. 1528 crores, despite higher tax incidence. Our long-term debt is at US $550 million, which was mainly used to fund the InvaGen acquisition and RAND 100 million for Mirren acquisition. We also have working capital loans of about $48 million and South African RAND 250 million which acts as natural hedges towards all receivables. Total net debt-to-equity is 0.10. Outstanding forward contract as a hedge for receivables as on 31st March is US $135 million and South African RAND 374 million. During the quarter, we have also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. The outstanding forward contracts as cash flow hedges as of 31st March are US $162 million and South African RAND 240 million. As we enter FY20,capital deployment and intelligent resource allocation to support growth across our businesses and capital productivity will be important themes. I would now request Umang to discuss the business and operational performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. Welcome all of you on the call today. I would like to start with an update on the overall year and the guidance, but I am happy to note how our base numbers on both sales and EBITDA have ramped up this quarter. Overall, the first half of the year was challenging with multiple headwinds,we came out strongly in the second half of the year with key market showing good momentum in line with our May 22, 2019 expectations. As we enter FY20, most of the challenges are largely behind us and our core business numbers are largely rebased. As guided, we are happy to report that the overall domestic business, which includes branded, generics and our OTC business delivered INR 6,420 crores. This is in line with our guidance range of 6,300 crores to 6,400 crores from our domestic sales in the year. The branded pharma business continued to deliver strong market performance and grew 11.2% versus market growth of 10.5% as per IQVIA MAT March 19. Our outperformance across key therapies of respi, cardiology, urology continued during the year. Our generic business in India continued its consistent performance and grew in double digits. In South Africa private market, where Cipla is the third largest player, we continued to deliver consistent market-leading performance, growing 3x the market at 10.4% versus the market growth of 3.1% as per IQVIA MAT March 19. The Mirren portfolio, which we recently acquired, will further strengthen our position in the fast-growing OTC market in South Africa. The tender business rebasing played out in line with our commentary and may play out in the next 1 to 2 quarters of the year. As we announced during the quarter, we are happy that Cipla has retained its fair share of the South Africa tender for TEE and TLD and will start supplying these quantities soon. In line with our expectations and on the back of strong launches during the year, the U.S. business continued its strong trajectory in Q4. The Q4 sales grew by 38% on a quarter-on-quarter basis driven by strong performance in existing differentiated launches and sales from our launch of Cinacalcet. Normalized for Cinacalcet, our exit run rate was in line with our guidance of US $120 million to $125 million for the quarter. Our global tender business went through rebasing this year. We are continuing to evaluate our portfolio choices in this business and play selectively for value. Our emerging market territory declined 4% year-on-year, behind challenges in the Middle East markets. We continue to invest towards expanding our biosimilars franchise in the region. During quarter 4, we added pegfilgrastim for Australia, New Zealand, Colombia and Malaysia into our biosimilars portfolio. We expect biosimilars to become an important growth driver for the business in the near to medium term. As we had articulated, we are progressing well on establishing our presence in the growth markets of China and Brazil. On specialty, we further expanded our portfolio and licensed Pulmazole, which is inhaled itraconazole. This is an important asset for us from a respiratory specialty perspective and gives us a unique opportunity to address an important unmet need in asthmatic patients suffering from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Maintaining our facilities at the highest standard of quality and compliance is non-negotiable for us. During quarter 4, we were inspected at our Kurkumbh plant. We have already responded to the agency. We were also inspected recently at our Indore plant where we had 0 observations May 22, 2019 from PAI inspection. We also received the EIR for the January 19 US FDA inspection at our Goa plant. Our R&D pipeline is progressing as per plan. We filed 4 more assets during the last quarter, taking the full year filing come to 20, including 2 in-licensed assets. Going forward, our target would be to invest towards high-value opportunities. Our respiratory trial program is on track and we are expecting to file 2 respiratory products in FY 20 and have a launch 1 year after that. Let me move to the business wise performance. In India, on a full year basis, we reported an 8% growth adjusted for GST. Through the year, our prescription growth continued to remain at 9% versus the market of 7%. This year, with secondary sales on track and destocking in the market largely done, we believe our inventory has normalized to healthy levels and this gives us a comfortable base for FY20. As per our guidance in the last call, for this quarter, the business delivered a reported double- digit growth rate of 11% on a Y-o-Y basis with both prescription and generic businesses showing strong momentum despite the reverse seasonality kicking in. This has been driven by strong execution supported by superior prescription generation and market-leading growth across our therapies. As per IQVIA MAT March 19, Cipla continued its strong performance with respiratory growing by 19% versus a market growth of 11%, cardiology growing at 18% versus a market growth of 12%, urology growing at 19% versus a market growth of 17% and CNS growing at 16% versus the market growth of 10%. Overall, in chronic therapies, Cipla became the second biggest player in India during the year growing over 18% versus the market growth of 13% and market share increasing from 7.5% to 7.8%. We are also very happy to share that we recently entered into a strategic partnership with LG Life Sciences and in-licensed their entire portfolio of marketed products in India. This partnership marks Ciplas foray in the high growth and specialty segments of infertility and the human growth hormone business. For the North America business, we are extremely pleased to report the business grew 41% year- on-year and 38% quarter-on-quarter to US $163 million during the quarter, driven by a ramp-up of existing products and the launch of Cinacalcet. Normalizing for the sales of Cinacalcet, the base business delivered a robust growth and in line with our guidance of US $120 million to US $125 million. For the full year, the business registered an overall growth of 18% on a year-on- year basis. We also continued to do well on our guidance of one limited competition launch every quarter and we will maintain this as we progress. As we alluded to earlier, we are progressing well on our trials for respiratory products and are targeting to file 2 products in the U.S. this year, launch one and have one launch every year starting with the next year. May 22, 2019 In the South Africa and Global Access region, what we call SAGA, our South Africa private market recorded its strong trajectory growth growing 3x the market as per IQVIA MAT. With the Mirren portfolio fully integrated, we believe the business is set up for strong growth across the OTC and prescription side of the business. Expanding our offering to patients in South Africa beyond medicines, we acquired a 30% stake in Brandmed, a connected health solutions company. Our investment in Brandmed follows our investment and partnership with Wellthy Therapeutics in India. As mentioned earlier, Cipla South Africa has retained its fair share in the South Africa tender awarded for the next 3 years. We expect to initiate supplies based on this tender soon. Outside of South Africa, we believe that the tender business has rebased largely during the year with the CGA business degrowing almost 36% this year. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio of choices in the Global Access business. The emerging markets business declined 4%, largely due to challenges in the Middle Eastern markets. We will continue to watch the global developments concerning some of these markets and stay cautious. We have also mentioned about biosimilars earlier. We are working towards accelerating our entry in China and Brazil which are chosen growth markets within the region. On the specialty business, outside of Pulmazole, we also had expanded IV Tramadol in the earlier part of the year. We expect Avenue to report data by the end of quarter 1 from the pivotal Phase III trial of IV Tramadol for management of postoperative pain in patients following abdominoplasty surgery. To close, we remain optimistic and believe there are strong growth opportunities across our businesses. FY20 will be a year for us to further enhance our operational execution and leverage the opportunities offered across markets. I would like to summarize our objectives by market. In India, we would like to ramp up our chronic therapies and the acute therapies across the in-licensed and specialty brands. We expect this business to deliver market-beating growth. In South Africa, while the tender business softness linked with price declines will kick in, we believe our private market portfolio can deliver significant delta to drive growth in the overall business. For the U.S. market, we will continue to focus on building the trajectory backed up by ramp up of the existing launches. This year is also expected to see Ciplas first inhaler launch in the U.S. We will maintain a strong filing trajectory focusing on high-value products. On specialty, we remain committed to building the next regime of sustainable growth for the company. We will continue to evaluate assets that serve unmet needs and expand the portfolio in the areas of respiratory, CNS and the channel of the institutional business. Quality and compliance remain the bedrock of our business, and we will continue to operate our facilities with the highest level of compliance and control and on the operation side, we have progressed May 22, 2019 significantly from the challenges we faced in FY19. Our focus will be to ensure strong backend execution to deliver products to serve patients across our markets. I would like to thank you for your attention and I will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

It is a 3- year tender and so prices get reset every 3 years. This is the first year of the 3-year tender. So, from the last tender to this tender, the prices have moved South, which is usual of this business. So, therefore, on the tender side, we may see a little softness in South Africa, but overall, the business is aiming to cover that softness with the strong growth on the private side of the market. In the Global Access business, our business has kind of rebased. A) We are not starting off a high base, and the TLE, TEE prices have moved significantly South, but we will only play the market for products where we think because we are margin accretive.",

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen and good evening to all of you. Welcome to our earnings call for the fourth quarter of financial year 2019. I hope you have received the investor presentation that we have posted on our website. Overall, for the financial year despite challenges in the first half, we had a strong second half and are entering FY20 on an optimistic note. We are happy to see that our focus markets have performed in line with our expectations and guidance. EBITDA margins expanded by 700 bps in quarter 4 versus last year and by about 80 basis points in the full year,.Our profit after-tax for the full year also increased by 8% despite higher tax incidence in the year. FY19 was an extremely successful year with many firsts in Ciplas growth story. To highlight a few: In India, we launched one of the largest consumers awareness campaign, called as, Berok Zindagi for respiratory, which is a therapy which continues to be our biggest growth driver. We also significantly ramped up our specialty portfolio with in-licensed offerings in diabetology, cardiology and womens health. Recently, we also launched Synchrobreathe and Niveoli as novel offerings in the respiratory. May 22, 2019 To build a specialty business in U.S. as our second engine, the year saw our largest speciality deals with a proposed acquisition to Avenue Therapeutics. This business will continue to see traction as we progress and will have its own capital requirements. Adding our first respiratory specialty asset, we have licensed Pulmazole, which is an inhaled Itraconazole solution. On the generic side, we significantly ramped up our market share in differentiated product categories and IP-enabled products. In South Africa, we expanded our OTC offerings with the acquisition of Mirren. The acquisition has given us access to a high growth portfolio with strong synergies with our existing commercial infrastructure. We also became the third largest pharma company in the private market in South Africa. As you are aware, in Uganda, we concluded the IPO of the subsidiary on the Ugandan Stock Exchange. To go beyond the pill and help patients manage their conditions better, we invested towards establishing a digital footprint. In India, we invested in Wellthy along with a commercial partnership to expand our offerings in diabetology and cardiology. In South Africa, we invested in Brandmed and acquired 30% stake to provide connected health solutions to the patients. Coming to the quarterly and full year results: The quarter overall revenues from operations are Rs 4,404 crores, which registered a growth of 19% on a year-on-year basis. The quarter saw all our businesses performing in line with our guidance. India business grew by 11% on Y-o-Y basis and U.S. business saw significant ramp up, driven by the launch of cinacalcet and grew 41% year-on-year and 38% on a quarter-on- quarter. When normalized for the contribution from cinacalcet, the U.S. business trajectory was quite in line with our expected exit run rate as guided in the last call. We also saw strong growth in the Europe and API businesses during the quarter. On a full year, the revenue from the operations are at Rs 16,362 crores, which grew by 8% on a year-on-year basis, supported by strong growth across focused markets. This is despite the fact that we saw significant rebasing in the tender side of the business, challenges in the Middle Eastern markets and certain supply challenges throughout the year. Gross margin after material cost stood at 66.3% for the quarter, which increased by 300 basis points on a sequential basis and 200 basis points on Y-o-Y basis. The expansions in the quarters gross margins are driven by contribution from the U.S. launches we alluded to earlier. For the full year, the gross margin stood at 65% marginally higher of fiscal 18. For the quarter, total expenses, which include employee costs and other expenses, stood at Rs. 1957 crores, increasing 7% on a sequential basis. The employee cost for the quarter stood at Rs. 712 crores, declined marginally on a sequential basis. Other expenses, which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion expense stood at 1245 crores, increasing May 22, 2019 11% on a sequential basis. This increase was largely driven by our growth investments in branded markets and clinical trial expenses. Total R&D expenses are at 7.1% of revenue. It is on expected lines as we progress on our key assets and as Advair clinical trials progress. EBITDA for the quarter stands at Rs. 972 crores or 22.1% to sales. During the quarter, these margins expanded by 700 bps and 75% on an absolute terms. For the full year, we saw an expansion of EBITDA margin by 80 bps. A part of this expansion has come on the back of new launches this quarter, which may not sustain fully going forward and hence we would like you to be aware of possible moderation. At the same time, this quarter includes certain litigation and provisions linked to delayed receivables and other spends in toto of approximately Rs. 50 crores over the usual baseline. Adjusted for this benefit, on a sustainable basis, the EBITDA has shown a very strong double- digit growth versus last year and at our base levels, despite seasonality in the current quarter. You would have noticed an increase in the amortization and impairment line. There is a noncash impairment adjustment of Rs. 206 crores pertaining to our U.S. business. There is a corresponding release in the tax line because of this item. Tax charge for the quarter stood at Rs. 128 crores. For the full year, ETR is at 27%. Profit after tax for the quarter is Rs. 367 crores or 8.3% of sales, which is an increase of 106% over last year. For the full year, profit after tax increased by 8% to Rs. 1528 crores, despite higher tax incidence. Our long-term debt is at US $550 million, which was mainly used to fund the InvaGen acquisition and RAND 100 million for Mirren acquisition. We also have working capital loans of about $48 million and South African RAND 250 million which acts as natural hedges towards all receivables. Total net debt-to-equity is 0.10. Outstanding forward contract as a hedge for receivables as on 31st March is US $135 million and South African RAND 374 million. During the quarter, we have also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. The outstanding forward contracts as cash flow hedges as of 31st March are US $162 million and South African RAND 240 million. As we enter FY20,capital deployment and intelligent resource allocation to support growth across our businesses and capital productivity will be important themes. I would now request Umang to discuss the business and operational performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. Welcome all of you on the call today. I would like to start with an update on the overall year and the guidance, but I am happy to note how our base numbers on both sales and EBITDA have ramped up this quarter. Overall, the first half of the year was challenging with multiple headwinds,we came out strongly in the second half of the year with key market showing good momentum in line with our May 22, 2019 expectations. As we enter FY20, most of the challenges are largely behind us and our core business numbers are largely rebased. As guided, we are happy to report that the overall domestic business, which includes branded, generics and our OTC business delivered INR 6,420 crores. This is in line with our guidance range of 6,300 crores to 6,400 crores from our domestic sales in the year. The branded pharma business continued to deliver strong market performance and grew 11.2% versus market growth of 10.5% as per IQVIA MAT March 19. Our outperformance across key therapies of respi, cardiology, urology continued during the year. Our generic business in India continued its consistent performance and grew in double digits. In South Africa private market, where Cipla is the third largest player, we continued to deliver consistent market-leading performance, growing 3x the market at 10.4% versus the market growth of 3.1% as per IQVIA MAT March 19. The Mirren portfolio, which we recently acquired, will further strengthen our position in the fast-growing OTC market in South Africa. The tender business rebasing played out in line with our commentary and may play out in the next 1 to 2 quarters of the year. As we announced during the quarter, we are happy that Cipla has retained its fair share of the South Africa tender for TEE and TLD and will start supplying these quantities soon. In line with our expectations and on the back of strong launches during the year, the U.S. business continued its strong trajectory in Q4. The Q4 sales grew by 38% on a quarter-on-quarter basis driven by strong performance in existing differentiated launches and sales from our launch of Cinacalcet. Normalized for Cinacalcet, our exit run rate was in line with our guidance of US $120 million to $125 million for the quarter. Our global tender business went through rebasing this year. We are continuing to evaluate our portfolio choices in this business and play selectively for value. Our emerging market territory declined 4% year-on-year, behind challenges in the Middle East markets. We continue to invest towards expanding our biosimilars franchise in the region. During quarter 4, we added pegfilgrastim for Australia, New Zealand, Colombia and Malaysia into our biosimilars portfolio. We expect biosimilars to become an important growth driver for the business in the near to medium term. As we had articulated, we are progressing well on establishing our presence in the growth markets of China and Brazil. On specialty, we further expanded our portfolio and licensed Pulmazole, which is inhaled itraconazole. This is an important asset for us from a respiratory specialty perspective and gives us a unique opportunity to address an important unmet need in asthmatic patients suffering from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Maintaining our facilities at the highest standard of quality and compliance is non-negotiable for us. During quarter 4, we were inspected at our Kurkumbh plant. We have already responded to the agency. We were also inspected recently at our Indore plant where we had 0 observations May 22, 2019 from PAI inspection. We also received the EIR for the January 19 US FDA inspection at our Goa plant. Our R&D pipeline is progressing as per plan. We filed 4 more assets during the last quarter, taking the full year filing come to 20, including 2 in-licensed assets. Going forward, our target would be to invest towards high-value opportunities. Our respiratory trial program is on track and we are expecting to file 2 respiratory products in FY 20 and have a launch 1 year after that. Let me move to the business wise performance. In India, on a full year basis, we reported an 8% growth adjusted for GST. Through the year, our prescription growth continued to remain at 9% versus the market of 7%. This year, with secondary sales on track and destocking in the market largely done, we believe our inventory has normalized to healthy levels and this gives us a comfortable base for FY20. As per our guidance in the last call, for this quarter, the business delivered a reported double- digit growth rate of 11% on a Y-o-Y basis with both prescription and generic businesses showing strong momentum despite the reverse seasonality kicking in. This has been driven by strong execution supported by superior prescription generation and market-leading growth across our therapies. As per IQVIA MAT March 19, Cipla continued its strong performance with respiratory growing by 19% versus a market growth of 11%, cardiology growing at 18% versus a market growth of 12%, urology growing at 19% versus a market growth of 17% and CNS growing at 16% versus the market growth of 10%. Overall, in chronic therapies, Cipla became the second biggest player in India during the year growing over 18% versus the market growth of 13% and market share increasing from 7.5% to 7.8%. We are also very happy to share that we recently entered into a strategic partnership with LG Life Sciences and in-licensed their entire portfolio of marketed products in India. This partnership marks Ciplas foray in the high growth and specialty segments of infertility and the human growth hormone business. For the North America business, we are extremely pleased to report the business grew 41% year- on-year and 38% quarter-on-quarter to US $163 million during the quarter, driven by a ramp-up of existing products and the launch of Cinacalcet. Normalizing for the sales of Cinacalcet, the base business delivered a robust growth and in line with our guidance of US $120 million to US $125 million. For the full year, the business registered an overall growth of 18% on a year-on- year basis. We also continued to do well on our guidance of one limited competition launch every quarter and we will maintain this as we progress. As we alluded to earlier, we are progressing well on our trials for respiratory products and are targeting to file 2 products in the U.S. this year, launch one and have one launch every year starting with the next year. May 22, 2019 In the South Africa and Global Access region, what we call SAGA, our South Africa private market recorded its strong trajectory growth growing 3x the market as per IQVIA MAT. With the Mirren portfolio fully integrated, we believe the business is set up for strong growth across the OTC and prescription side of the business. Expanding our offering to patients in South Africa beyond medicines, we acquired a 30% stake in Brandmed, a connected health solutions company. Our investment in Brandmed follows our investment and partnership with Wellthy Therapeutics in India. As mentioned earlier, Cipla South Africa has retained its fair share in the South Africa tender awarded for the next 3 years. We expect to initiate supplies based on this tender soon. Outside of South Africa, we believe that the tender business has rebased largely during the year with the CGA business degrowing almost 36% this year. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio of choices in the Global Access business. The emerging markets business declined 4%, largely due to challenges in the Middle Eastern markets. We will continue to watch the global developments concerning some of these markets and stay cautious. We have also mentioned about biosimilars earlier. We are working towards accelerating our entry in China and Brazil which are chosen growth markets within the region. On the specialty business, outside of Pulmazole, we also had expanded IV Tramadol in the earlier part of the year. We expect Avenue to report data by the end of quarter 1 from the pivotal Phase III trial of IV Tramadol for management of postoperative pain in patients following abdominoplasty surgery. To close, we remain optimistic and believe there are strong growth opportunities across our businesses. FY20 will be a year for us to further enhance our operational execution and leverage the opportunities offered across markets. I would like to summarize our objectives by market. In India, we would like to ramp up our chronic therapies and the acute therapies across the in-licensed and specialty brands. We expect this business to deliver market-beating growth. In South Africa, while the tender business softness linked with price declines will kick in, we believe our private market portfolio can deliver significant delta to drive growth in the overall business. For the U.S. market, we will continue to focus on building the trajectory backed up by ramp up of the existing launches. This year is also expected to see Ciplas first inhaler launch in the U.S. We will maintain a strong filing trajectory focusing on high-value products. On specialty, we remain committed to building the next regime of sustainable growth for the company. We will continue to evaluate assets that serve unmet needs and expand the portfolio in the areas of respiratory, CNS and the channel of the institutional business. Quality and compliance remain the bedrock of our business, and we will continue to operate our facilities with the highest level of compliance and control and on the operation side, we have progressed May 22, 2019 significantly from the challenges we faced in FY19. Our focus will be to ensure strong backend execution to deliver products to serve patients across our markets. I would like to thank you for your attention and I will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

It is a 3- year tender and so prices get reset every 3 years. This is the first year of the 3-year tender. So, from the last tender to this tender, the prices have moved South, which is usual of this business. So, therefore, on the tender side, we may see a little softness in South Africa, but overall, the business is aiming to cover that softness with the strong growth on the private side of the market. In the Global Access business, our business has kind of rebased. A) We are not starting off a high base, and the TLE, TEE prices have moved significantly South, but we will only play the market for products where we think because we are margin accretive.",

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen, and good evening to all of you. Welcome to our earnings call for the Q1 FY2020. I hope you have received the investor presentation that we have posted on our website. Overall, numbers for the quarter reflect some challenges in the business environment and several one-offs, including some cutoff issues. This quarter saw the impact of change in distribution patterns playing out significantly for our trade generics business in India. This was on expected lines. And as we had planned and commented over the last quarter.This has resulted in the growth in our trade generics business because of this conscious change, which is an impact of about Rs.200 Crores. On the prescription business side in India, we saw deferral of dispatches to July. This is in line with our sales cutoff practices for the quarter. This affected the prescription business year-on-year growth by about 5% point. Cipla Limited August 07, 2019 On the emerging markets side as well, which quarterly numbers got impacted by the deferral of these dispatches. Part of this was because of the monsoon situation towards the end of June and runway closure at the airport. This will be recovered in the next quarter. Overall, the higher cutoff has deferred sales to an extent about Rs.150 Crores in these two businesses. In South Africa, while the tender softness got played out as expected, we continued to deliver on our market ranks for a private market business. In the Sub-Saharan region, due to the pending clarity on certain receivables, we took a conscious call to delay acceptance of certain orders, which partly impacted the delivery of the revenues by the region. In the U.S., excluding the contribution from Cinacalcet, the base business grew year-on-year. Including the contribution from Cinacalcet, the business has grown impressively by 61% year-on-year. Despite all these challenges and revenue deferrals for the quarter, the performance was benefited by contribution from Cinacalcet, as I mentioned. And hence, the profitability was maintained at very healthy levels with EBITDA growing 25% on a year-on-year basis. Driven by significant cash flow generation and focused efforts, our net debt-to-equity ratio is now at 0.06. While the quarterly numbers appear subdued because of all these factors, we expect most of this will normalize over the coming couple of quarters. The underlying businesses and the order flow show encouraging signs across our key markets, and we will remain focused to resolve some of these transitory issues. With that, let me come to some of the financial numbers, overall, income from operations for the quarter is Rs.3989 Crores, which recorded year-over-year growth of 1.3%. Gross margin after material cost stood at 70% for the quarter driven by contribution from Cinacalcet. During the quarter, we maintained tight control on expenses. Total expenses which include employee cost and other expenses stood at about Rs.1888 Crores, which declined 4% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for this quarter stood at Rs.756 Crores, an increase of 6% largely due to annual increments. Other expenses line, which includes R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion expenses are at Rs.1132 Crores, decreased 9% on a sequential basis. During this quarter, in the other expense line, there is an accrual of about Rs.40 Crores towards delayed collections from a customer. Total R&D investment for this quarter stood at 6.5% of revenues, which is Rs.261 Crores. We expect this to ramp up in the coming quarters in line with the progress of the generic Advair trial and other development Cipla Limited August 07, 2019 programs. EBITDA for the quarter is about Rs.905 Crores or 23% of sales. Tax charge is about Rs.192 Crores, which is 29% to sales. Were looking at full year effective tax rate of 29% to 30%. As a net result, the profit after tax stood at Rs.478 Crores or 12% of sales. Today, we also announced that in a mutually agreed and planned transition, Cipla Limited and Eight Roads have signed the definitive agreement for Cipla Limited to acquire the minority stake of Eight Roads in our consumer health care subsidiary. Thereby giving Cipla Limited 100% ownership interest of the Cipla Health Limited. This development comes in view of Ciplas growing focus on consumer-facing products and the high potential of synergy between CHL and Cipla in-house portfolios. Our long-term debt is at USD 550 million, which was mainly used to fund the InvaGen acquisition about 3 years back and rand 100 million for the acquisition done for Mirren’s assets in South Africa. We also have working capital was over USD 19 million and South African rand 320 million which act as natural hedges towards the receivables. Total net debt to equity, as I mentioned, is about 0.06. Outstanding forward contract as a hedge for receivables as of June 30 are $175 million and South African rand 567 million. During the quarter, we also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. The outstanding forward contracts and options as cash flow hedges as of June 30 are USD 147 million and rand 285 million. With this, I would now like to invite Umang to present the business and operational performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. Though this quarter had multiple transitory impacts playing out in most of our markets, I believe the fundamental strength of our business remains strong. Let me highlight some key milestones we achieved this quarter in line with our long-term aspiration of building multiple levers for growth: One, secondary performance in private markets. Cipla India continues strong secondary performance across key therapies, outpacing the market significantly in Respiratory and Cardiology. IQVIA MAT numbers suggest that they are growing in both therapies at 14%, which is significantly higher than market. South Africa private business continues to outpace the market. It grew by over 2x the market at 7.3%. On the U.S. generic side, Cinacalcet continued to drive significant growth in the market. We also received two approvals this quarter in Ambrisentan and Pregabalin. Excluding Cinacalcet, our base business also showed respectable growth versus the previous Q1FY19. Our respiratory trials continue to be on-track for generic Advair. Cipla Limited August 07, 2019 On the specialty business, as you would have read in our press release, Cipla acquired the rights to Zemdri which is IV form of Plazomicin from Achaogen in a Chapter 11, U.S. Bankruptcy Code Auction of the Achaogen assets. Zemdri is in approved product in the U.S. and will be Cipla’s first commercial specialty asset; we believe this transaction will have strong commercial synergies with IV Tramadol, which showed positive results in the Phase III trial. Cipla has been a leading industry voice in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance and Zemdri further underscores Ciplas commitment to the stewardship. Consumer business is a growth driver for us, and our consolidation of this business is an indication of that. Starting this quarter, as Kedar mentioned, our transaction with Eight Roads, the consumer business will see significant amounts of interest and effort in the consumerization story in India. On the emerging markets side, we have signed definitive agreement to form a manufacturing JV and opened our office in China. China is a crucial part of our future emerging market roadmap, and we are at a critical juncture in establishing a respiratory franchise in the market. We will also explore routes to add oncology products to our portfolio in the future. Despite all this volatility, the profitability for the quarter was maintained at healthy levels. Let us move to the detailed business performance now. In India, for the quarter, the business reported a year-on-year decline of 12%. This decline was due to our change of distributors in the generic side of our business. As we had guided in the last call, this is a result of a conscious call taken to prepare our distribution system for the post-GST environment where we normalized our inventory levels and derisked our distributor concentration to maintain the long-term health of the business. We noticed patterns of consolidated buying in the channel, which may have caused disruption, and hence, our actions on channel have led to a derisking of the business. We expect this business to normalize fully in Q3 and get back to healthy growth thereafter. On the prescription side, we recorded a deferral of dispatches in July in accordance with our cutoff procedures of almost Rs.60 Crores, impacting the business growth by 5% points. On the secondary side, Cipla continued to perform well across key therapeutic areas. Chronic therapies continue to drive a significant share of growth and grew at 14% as per IQVIA versus the 12% market growth. Amongst our key therapies in Respiratory, Cipla grew by 14% versus a market growth of 9%. In Cardiology, Cipla grew 18% versus the market growth of 12% in Cardiology. We continue to maintain our leadership position across Respiratory and Urology. Ten of the top 22 brands of Cipla that feature in the top 300 brands in IPM have outpaced the industry growth. Ciplas proprietary breath-actuated inhaler Seroflo, Synchrobreathe has touched Rs.11 Crores in the first year of launch. Cipla Limited August 07, 2019 In the SAGA region, which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan and Cipla Global Access business, our South Africa private market continued its strong secondary sales growth trajectory, growing over two times the market at 7.3% as per IQVIA MAT June 19. The primary growth for the quarter is expected to normalize over the year. The acquired portfolio of Mirren in the OTC space delivered over 10% growth. As mentioned in our earlier call, Cipla South Africa has started delivering the new tender supplies, and hence we expect our tender business to be rebased accordingly in the coming quarters. Outside of South Africa, we have held certain supplies contingent around the visibility of receivables. In the North America business, including Cinacalcet, the business grew 61% year-on-year to USD 161 million during the quarter. It normalized for the sales of Cinacalcet, the base business also grew year-on-year. The quarter for the approval, as we mentioned, of two assets Ambrisentan and Pregabalin. In line with our strategy to increase share of new launches in Q1 including Cinacalcet, over 45% of the sales were contributed by products launched in the last 12 months, which also led to our gross margin expanding by over 10% points. We are progressing well on our trials for respiratory products and are targeting to file two products in the U.S. this year. The emerging markets business has recorded one of the highest quarterly run rate in last year Q1 driven by a one-time tender opportunity that we had in Venezuela. Due to this high base of last year, we believe the numbers are not comparable on a year-to-year basis. The quarterly delivery also got impacted by deferral of dispatches to the first week of July on the revenue recognition side and the continuing challenges in the Middle Eastern markets. We continue to watch global developments. Recently, we announced our partnership with Alvotech on Adalimumab for select emerging markets. We also signed another deal to in-licence Etanercept for emerging markets, including the countries of Australia and New Zealand. We expect these to be significant growth drivers in the near term. On the regulatory front, we received EIR for our Kurkumbh plant which was audited in March. Recently, we were also inspected at our API plant in Virgonagar in Bengaluru. The inspection ended with seven observations none of which are either repeat or related to data integrity. We will respond to the agency within the stipulated time. To close, we have identified very clear near- to medium-term priorities for our key markets. In India, our focus will be to drive further growth in chronic portfolio and launch key patient-focused initiatives in Respiratory. We are working towards driving improved execution on the acute side by focusing on micro markets. We expect the business to drive above market growth in the rest of the year. On the generic side, post the channel destocking, we believe this business will get back on a growth trajectory by Q3. In South Africa, while the tender business softness will kick in, we believe our private market’s Cipla Limited August 07, 2019 portfolio can deliver significant delta to drive growth in the overall business. And for the U.S. market, we will resume our limited competition launches in Q3 with some meaningful launches coming up. I would like to thank you for your attention and will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

However, the bigger issue is linked to our Gx business and in the Gx business, we have had almost a churn of over 100 distributors linked to this business because we realized that there was some destabilization happening of our distribution chain.

And then we had to cure this instability because it was beginning to affect the distributors who had genuine demand around the areas that they were selling and that is what we have done. We have almost churned the distribution mix here and this mix will almost contribute in to 50% of our sales and those distributors now, the churn distributors are obviously not with the system.

So it is a business where the velocity of what you put in is impacted. If you do not put in anything, there is no velocity in the business, right? Now in this business because it is very difficult to estimate the demand coming out of tier 3 and tier 4 cities, the way the demand is satisfied is through what exists in the channel. What had happened in this business is as it is not so much about destocking. It is that different distributors over the year have been sitting at a different acquisition price and so even if the inventory levels are, perhaps, normal, there was instability in the chain because GST has removed friction cost on how goods can move through the city. So today sitting there, I could be buying goods that have been sold in Bengal or buying goods that are being sold in Kerala. And if I am sitting here, pharma distributor, my margins are always not high to do a trade business, right? The entire distribution trade business in stockist level happens at 10% margin, right? So I think there is an issue with just the different price points that were existing in this market as well as, perhaps, you are right and a fair amount of stock level that were there on this side of the business. So we have had to effectively, what we had to do is bring the stock levels down so that the incentive and make sure that the stocks which were lying at different price points are liquidated in the market. So that going forward, there is not too much of this instability that can be a caused in the distribution chain.",

Are we trying to focus more on that piece going forward? R Ananth: So API continues to be equally important part of our business. There is no specific additional focus. It continues to be important. It is a good business. And we are doing pretty good with some of the lock-ins with customers on the products. It will continue to grow the way currently it is growing.",

Okay, so we have a Rs.1 lakh Crore market. If you look at what has happened in the recent two years or three years, there is Jan Aushadhi, which is a scheme run by the government, they are reporting about $50 million. So at the equivalent pricing, that $50 million in our side of the trade is almost close to, let us say, about Rs.2500 Crores to Rs.3000 Crores, right? So that is 3% of the market now where some growth is coming from. Then if you look at all the e-pharmacies and the buying groups that have emerged for hospitals and otherwise, that is another, in my belief, roughly about Rs.3000 Crores to Rs.5000 Crores. So you have had almost Rs.8000 Crores to Rs.9000 Crores worth of buying pattern that has changed in the industry which otherwise was an industry that was growing at 10%. Some of this has been substitution demand. Some of this has come because the industry is not growing faster. It is growing at the same pace. In fact, it is probably slowed down. The impact of this is going to be felt on the regular retail trade, right? And that is the impact we are seeing. So our analysis is that there is growth in the industry, but it is coming from different pockets now in different sources of buying than from before. So that however, most of these comments are for the branded prescription buying market, it is not for the generic. The generic is at a different thing, and we have explained that earlier. So this is the branded side. So that is why growth, if you were asking me why growth is slowing, I think growth is slowing as a result of this, and it will possibly take a while for the trade to stabilize, both in terms of pharmacies to mature and how they buy as well as from a perspective of the Jan Aushadhi and how quickly it expands.",

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen and good evening to all of you. Welcome to our Earnings Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2020. I hope you have received the investor presentation that we posted on our website. This quarter is quite strong for us and stable after a muted quarter one which highlights the inherent strength of our businesses. This quarter has seen significant recovery and stabilization of the distribution model change on the trade generic side, strong growth in the prescription branded business in India with seasonal triggers driving growth in acute therapies as well, continued momentum in the South African private market business, and retention of share in key assets in the US despite multiple competitive entries. On Cinacalcet, contribution in value terms has substantially normalized in the quarter and it is quite close to measuring at the base levels. With this comment, let me come to the financials for the quarter: November 06, 2019 For the quarter, overall revenue from operations stands at 4,396 crores which recorded a healthy year-on-year growth of 10% with strong performance across our key businesses of India, South Africa and US. I would like to clarify that the numbers for the quarter do not include any significant benefit from the spillover that we had mentioned in the last quarter. For our India business, the net delta in the opening and closing spillover is nil. For emerging markets, it is around only $5 million or so. Gross margin after material cost stood at 67% for the quarter driven by increased share of Indian branded business, South African private business and our limited competition assets in the US. This got partially offset by the increased share of the generics business as compared to the last quarter. Total expenses which include employee costs and other expenses stood at 2,025 crores increased by 7% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for this quarter stood at Rs, 762 crores largely flattish on a sequential basis. Other expenses for this quarter which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion costs stood at 1,263 crores, an increase 12% on a sequential basis. This increase is driven by growth investments in various part of our business. Total R&D investment for this quarter stood at 7% of revenue or Rs. 295 crores. This includes charges for the ongoing respiratory trials for Advair. During the quarter, we completed the patient randomization for generic Advair in line with our targets. EBITDA for the quarter stands at Rs. 909 crores or 21% to sales. Tax charge for the quarter stood at Rs. 201 crores. We are looking at our full year ETR of 29% to 30%. I can explain the details on tax later. But this year, we propose to continue with the old regime of tax rates. Profit after tax stood at Rs. 471 crores or 11% to sales.d During the quarter, we prepaid loan of USD 110 million which was taken for the InvaGen acquisition almost 1 year in advance considering our cash holdings. Our long-term debt now stands at $440 million which is mainly used to fund the InvaGen acquisition and South African Rand 100 million for Mirren acquisition. We also have working capital loans which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Total net debt-to-equity ratio is at 0.08 and continues to be quite healthy. Outstanding forward contracts as a hedge for receivables as of 30th September are USD 235 million and South African Rand 541 million. During the quarter, we have also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. The outstanding cash flow as of 30th September are USD 168 million and South African Rand 280 million. Thank you and I would now like to invite Umang to present the Business and Operational Performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. We are pleased to report strong recovery across our businesses during the quarter with overall revenues growing 10% on a year-on-year basis. We are focused on continuing the momentum in the coming quarters. November 06, 2019 We took certain determined steps to strengthen commercial discipline which has demonstrated resilience and strong fundamentals of our business. Let me start with some of the key highlights for the quarter: India trade generics: During the quarter the change in the distribution model implemented in quarter 1 has stabilized and the business has come back strongly, highlighting the strength of our portfolio. The business recorded a quarter-on-quarter growth of over 60% on a reported basis while the order booking was even higher. Our billed numbers for the quarter were nearly the same as previous year. We are focused on continuing the journey in the coming quarters and quarter 3 should see the business growing over the previous year. On our India branded business - the business delivered strong numbers growing 13% year-on- year basis. We saw robust performance across all our key therapies which outpaced the market significantly. South Africa - Our business delivered strong performance growing 12% year-on-year in ZAR terms. The private market business recovered strongly growing at 13% in local currency terms during the quarter. As per IQVIA, Cipla continued outperforming the market and grew over 3x the market growth rate at 7%. On the U.S. generic side - the business delivered 25% growth year-on-year basis to close the quarter at 135 million. We have retained share in Cinacalcet and as Kedar has said, it is Cinacalcet has reduced significantly from quarter 1. In emerging markets, we strengthened our portfolio offering in focus markets. In Sri Lanka, we entered into a strategic partnership with Novartis for marketing and distribution of the Ultibro Breezhaler. We are pleased to report that we have signed a strategic partnership with Novartis effective October 1st to market the respiratory portfolio in the Australian market. Overall, the revenue is growing 10% year-on-year. We saw EBITDA growing strongly at 21%. Let me move to the business-wise performance now: Overall, the India business including the generics and branded came strongly to deliver 29% growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis. This was driven by performance across key therapies and strong seasonal triggers on the branded side and a strong recovery on the generic side highlighting the resilience of the business post the distribution model change in quarter 1. We hope to continue the momentum in the coming quarters and drive growth in the business. The branded business grew 13% year-on-year driven by performance across both our chronic and acute therapies. Seasonal triggers help the acute business drive over 15% year-on-year growth in primary sales. November 06, 2019 On the secondary side, Cipla continued to perform well across key therapeutic areas. Chronic therapies in India continued to drive a significant share of growth for us and grew 15% as per IQVIA MAT September 2019 versus 12% for the industry. Amongst our key therapies, in Respiratory Cipla grew by 15% versus the market growth of 10%. In Cardiology, Cipla grew 17% versus the market growth of 12% and in Urology Cipla grew 15 versus the market growth of 14. We continue to maintain our leadership position across Respiratory and Urology. 14 of the top 22 brands of Cipla continued to feature among the top 300 brands in the IPM and have outpaced the industry growth as per IQVIA MAT September 2019. For the North America business - despite multiple competitors launching the generic product to Sensipar, we retained good market share in Cinacalcet. We have seen fairly aggressive price reduction for the product which was expected. In addition, on an overall basis launches such as Pregabalin have facilitated relatively strong growth of 25% on a year-on-year basis resulting in our numbers growing to 135 million. During the quarter, we announced the launch of Daptomycin as well. Increasing contribution from new launches has been driving gross margin expansion for the business. During quarter 2, we saw our gross margin expanded by 500 basis on a year-on-year basis. We are progressing well on our trials for respiratory products. We are currently tracking Albuterol as a launch in the early part of first half of 2021 and our limited competition engine should resume in quarter 4. In the SAGA region, which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Cipla Global Access business, our overall South Africa business grew strongly at 12% year-on-year in local currency. The private market business recovered strongly from quarter 1 to drive 13% year-on- year growth. In secondary terms, private market continued the momentum growing over 3x the market at 7% as reported by IQVIA MAT. With the acquired Mirren portfolio growing strongly, Cipla is the third largest player in the OTC market capturing a market share of 6.8. Outside of South Africa, the Sub-Saharan Africa business grew by 7%, while the CGA business declined due to lumpiness in order flows. The emerging markets business recorded a strong growth quarter-on-quarter to deliver 64 million and recovered from a muted Q1. Apart from the strategic partnership with Novartis, we are working towards bringing our EM biosimilar franchise to fruition with Pegfilgrastim filed in Malaysia and approval received for clinical trials of Bevacizumab in Algeria. November 06, 2019 On the institutional specialty business in the US, we plan to submit the IV Tramadol NDA later in the year via our associate company Avenue Therapeutics. We have resumed supplies of Plazomicin in the market. On the regulatory front, as we shared in our stock exchange announcement, we had an inspection at our Goa plant which ended with 12 observations. These observations are across our 10 units in Goa and none of them are either repeat or related to data integrity. We are working with the agency to address these and have submitted a comprehensive response to the agency. To close: While I am happy with the growth reported across markets, I believe our serviceability in product families could have been better. We are focused on continuing the momentum across the key markets in the coming quarters. Some of our key priorities are to continue to drive momentum in our India business. On the branded India business side, the coming quarters we will see the launch of Berok 2.0, Ciplas flagship patient focused initiatives in respiratory amongst other therapy focused initiatives. In South Africa, we believe our private market portfolio can continue to drive strong growth. In the U.S. market, we will resume with the limited competition launches in quarter 4 and we will be tracking our respiratory filings closely. We will manage the Sensipar / Cinacalcet product for value and retain a larger share of the market. We remain focused to maintain the highest standards of quality and compliance across the facilities. We will work with the agency on Goa resolution. I would like to thank you for your attention and I will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

Considering our size and looking at the market, I think somewhere upwards of the 15 million will qualify as limited competition provided you have a long enough window. Now within this, there will be some assets which will be larger. For example, we have been public about Albuterol earlier but some will be larger.

And I think the good thing is that the Plazomicin asset is already launched in the market. This we have already billed a fair number. It is going to take a long time to ramp up because anti-infective take relatively long to ramp up. But having said that it is a commercial asset, it is in the market. We do not have too large a team right now for it. We have got barely about 5 to 7 people who are key account managers selling the product. And closer to the Tramadol approval which we are going to be which our associate company Avenue will be filing hopefully by the end of this year. And closer to that approval which will possibly the next year end or early parts of January we will have a fully staffed specialty organization. So, I think there will be some expenses coming in. But the good news is that if we get Tramadol approval which we are very hopeful of. And we have got Plazomicin we will have 2 commercial assets already ready. So, we are hoping that the time period for this specialty expenditure to result in a sustainable business proposition will not take so long. We will be able to accelerate it.",

That part is a different set of issues and we have dealt with that. But it is my belief that the amount of change in the distribution side of the business is fairly significant. Between hospital groups who are buying as one, between pharmacies which are beginning to consolidate their buying and becoming supply partners to several independents. I think, there is an aggregation and consolidation thesis which is playing out here. And I think those changes are what are creating these timing mismatches between how companies are seeing the business and outside because I would like to believe that core volume growth is still there in the market. And it is coming at a respectable growth rate. So, I think it is probably because of the fact that we are in a cycle where the distribution systems in India are changing. And all of us, Cipla included have to respond to this. And so, the traditional stockist retailer model is probably going through tweaks and edits right now.",

I mean, I mentioned that the earlier conversation with Sameer what I was trying to say was that there are fundamental changes in the distribution side of the business. You have to understand that this business has 21 days of credit between company and the distributors there has barely 20-21 days of credit. And in some parts of the country, it is less than 10 and close to between 10 to 14 depending on whether you are metro or upcountry. For this business to run and because the cycle is 21 days there is an expectation from the distributor when he is selling it to the super stockist or to the retailer that his money also will come back in the same amount of time, right. So, as a result of this, as a result of the fact that there is a credit, there was a credit squeeze in the market which most segments are reporting including auto and everything else. As a result of the fact that a large share of the distribution trade changed after GST there was a shortage of this capital which resulted in the velocity of their business decreasing. Their natural response, so therefore to reduce inventories, right. Because the friction costs also had reduced which is what you are alluding to that are they might have improved their working capital cycle. This impact came on the companies. When distributors reduce their inventory, when their cash cycle in terms of their payments, etc. got delayed. It would have resulted in most companies showing a little bit of sluggishness in growth.",

But is not it correct that the margins in India are actually regulated, so even if they are buyer groups you can only sell it as 30% discount to the MRP because that is the amount of margin you are supposed to put on or are you envisaging that 3 years-4 years-5 years down the road once they become too large.

Some of the specific actions items that we are refer to have been addressed. In case of many products for the US the benefit of the augmentation has also been realized. So, some of the high margin revenues that we are seeing in US for products like Diclofenac gel or Budesonide is a result of these augmentation efforts that we undertook for the last 1 year.",

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen, and good evening to all of you. Welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. I hope you have received the investor presentation that we have posted on our website. Before sharing commentary on the numbers for the quarter, I would like to talk about certain key themes and capital allocation choices we are making. Over the last few quarters, weve consciously made relatively higher allocation towards the India prescription business in terms of investments. As an example, we are investing towards expanding our portfolio offerings in the market. Recently, as you know, weve acquired the Vysov brand from Novartis. Weve in-licensed patented product called Elores from Venus Remedies, many other investments that we have made through in-licensing. Similarly, the second edition of our flagship inhalation awareness campaign named as Berok Zindagi 2 is seeing very good progress. In the coming period, you will notice similar many more focused growth-enhancing initiatives. Secondly, we are coming off a peak in terms of R&D spends as generic Advair clinical trial, approximately $25 million of spend in the current financial year, comes to an end. We also see opportunities to rationalize the overall pipeline of the products under development. And youll notice a sharp focused approach for the generics pipeline in the coming days. Going forward, we will have on the specialty spends, which are primarily focused on only respiratory molecule February 05, 2020 instead of the total 3, which we had, including 2 in CNS that we have contracted for. Similarly, no major incremental spends will be made on the IV Tramadol until we have a definitive view on the categorization of the molecule from the agency. Finally, over the last few years, we have made focused efforts to drive improvement in the return- on-capital employed profile of the business. It used to be around 10-11% in FY18. The trailing 12 months of December 2019, we are around 13.9%, and we will continue this focus on improving the return on capital employed and invest aggressively towards return-accretive businesses. Coming to the quarter now: In line with our expectations and after a healthy quarter 2, we had yet another good quarter with strong performance across our businesses. This quarter has seen strong double-digit growth in the prescription business in India, with seasonal triggers driving growth in Respiratory and Acute segment. In line with our commentary in the last quarter, the trade generics business delivered year-on-year growth, highlighting healthy recovery post the model change. On the branded market franchise in South Africa, continued to deliver growth significantly above the market. In the U.S. generics business, despite multiple competitive entries across product categories, we retained a healthy share, delivering 133 million of sales during the quarter. Contribution from Cinacalcet is now largely normalized. The gross margin line this quarter is impacted by a couple of items. One is the shelf stock adjustment, which we have taken on the Cinacalcet post the drop in prices. Secondly, 120 basis point charge accounting adjustment towards the overhead due to the reduction in the finished goods inventory. And while the U.S. business topline on a quarter-on-quarter basis did not change materially, the mix is a bit different now with the erosion of Cinacalcet in the reported numbers versus last quarter. With that, let me come to the financials. For the quarter, overall income stands at Rs. 4,371 crores, recording a healthy 9% Y-o-Y growth. Gross margin after material cost is about 62% for the quarter on a reported basis. As highlighted earlier, this was impacted by nearly 200 basis points on account of Cinacalcet shelf stock adjustment, revenue mix in South Africa and overheads on the inventory. Total expenses, which include employee costs and other expenses, stood at Rs. 1,968 crores, declining 3% on a sequential basis. Employee costs for this quarter stood at Rs. 746 crores, declining 2% on a sequential basis. The other expense for this quarter, which included R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion expense, stood at 1,222, again declined by 3% on a sequential basis. Total R&D investments for this quarter stood at 7% of revenues or Rs. 308 crores. This includes charges for the ongoing respiratory trials. As mentioned earlier, February 05, 2020 R&D expenses are coming off the peak now and we will be more focused going forward. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter stood at 18.5% to sales and grew 13% over last year. Tax charge for the quarter is 153 crores. We are looking at a full year ETR of 29% to 30%. Profit after tax is at 351 crore or 8% of sales. Finally, our long-term debt now stands at US $440 million, which was mainly used to fund our U.S. acquisition, and South African ZAR 100 million for the Mirren acquisition. We also have working capital loans of $24 million, and South African ZAR 416 million, which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Total net debt-to-equity ratio is very healthy at 0.04. You would have seen healthy cash generation initiatives over the last several quarters. Outstanding forward contracts as a hedge for receivables as of 31st December are US $222 million and South African rand 627 million. During the quarter, we also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. And outstanding cash flow hedges as of 31st December are US $109 million and South African rand 212 million. With this, I would like to invite Umang to present the business and operational performance.",

      "content": "As we had mentioned in the last quarter, our trade generics business normalized in the last quarter and reported a strong revival in the quarter, growing 7% on a year-on-year basis. In South Africa, our business delivered strong performance, growing 9% year-on-year in ZAR terms. The private market business delivered strong numbers, growing 20% in local currency terms during the quarter. In U.S. generics, the business delivered 13% growth on a year-on-year basis to close the quarter at 133 million. Overall with revenues growing 9% year-on-year, we saw adjusted EBITDA growing 13% on a year-on-year basis and reported at close to 18.5%. With that, let me move to the business-wise performance. February 05, 2020 The Prescription business grew 14% year-on-year basis, driven by performance across both chronic and acute therapies. We will continue our focus on driving growth in our priority products portfolio and building stronger brands in the market. On the secondary side, Cipla continued to perform well across key therapeutic areas. Chronic therapies continue to drive a significant share of growth for us and grew 13% as per IQVIA MAT December 19 versus the 11% reported for the market. Amongst our key therapies, in Respiratory, Cipla grew by 13% versus market growth of 11%. In Cardiology, Cipla grew 14% versus a market growth of 11%. We continue to maintain our leadership position across Respiratory and Urology. In Diabetes, where we are a challenger with a strong portfolio, Cipla grew 17% versus the market growth of 12%. For the North America business, despite multiple competitors entering the markets in various product categories, we retained good share. In addition, on an overall basis, launches such as Pregabalin have facilitated relatively strong growth of 13% on a year-on-year basis to 133 million. Increasing contribution from the new launches has been driving gross margin expansion for the business. During quarter 3, the gross margin expanded by over 350 basis points versus the same quarter last year. On a YTD basis, the gross margin expansion is 750 basis points. We are progressing well on our trials for Advair, and our limited competition engine should resume launches very soon. In the SAGA region, which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan and Cipla Global Access business, all 3 businesses delivered strongly during the quarter. Our overall South Africa business grew strongly at 9% in local currency. The private market business delivered, as we mentioned before, 20%. In secondary terms, private market continued the momentum, growing at over 2x the market at 6.5% per IQVIA MAT December 19. Cipla ranked number 3 in the South African private market in both volume and value. We retained our position as one of the fastest-growing companies in pharma. Outside of South Africa, the Sub-Saharan African business grew 12% year-on-year basis, and the CGA business also delivered a growth of 7%. The Emerging Markets business declined 17% in the quarter due to order shipments getting pushed to quarter 4. We are expecting a healthy recovery in the next quarter. The quarter also saw the commercialization in this business of products in the market for our partnership with Novartis in Australia and in Sri Lanka. We are on track for all our biosimilar filings, including those for Australia. In Europe, our market share in FPSM now stands at over 15%. On the Institutional Specialty business in the U.S., in line with the commentary on the last call, we have submitted the IV Tramadol NDA via Avenue Therapeutics in December. On the regulatory front, we continue to work with the USFDA to comprehensively address the observations at Goa. We were recently inspected at our API facility in Bangalore as well and which ended in 4 observations, which are procedural in nature. Over the last year, we had a total of 6 of 8 USFDA inspections covering most of our facilities. We have already received the EIR for 6 of these, with Goa and Bangalore is pending as they were recently concluded. We remain February 05, 2020 extremely focused on maintaining the highest standards of quality across our manufacturing network, and we will work with the agency to comprehensively address the observations received in Goa. On a long-term note, we recently concluded a strategic review with our Board. As an outcome of the same, we would like to highlight our strategic priorities and key capital allocation choices as we build our business for sustainable growth in the future. Weve covered some of these in the Slide 3 of the investor presentation, and I will try and cover some of them on this call as well. The first refers to our continued investment in performance in India, we call it the One India initiative. Over years, Cipla has built a formidable prescription business and trade generics franchise in India. We have incubated our wellness business under Cipla Health, which now markets some of the most progressive brands in their categories. Going forward, we will integrate all the 3 businesses, prescription, trade generic and Cipla Health, under a single capital allocation framework. We believe there are strong synergies across portfolio distribution and consumer-focused initiatives amongst these 3 businesses, which will help the business deliver market-leading growth in the future. Under the One India initiative, we recently launched the TV campaign for OMNIGEL, Indias #1 pain relief gel. We will share more details in our future interactions. Our South Africa franchise remains strong and is on a strong footing. We will further strengthen our portfolio, including deepening the OTC space in the market. South Africa remains a key priority market for us. On the U.S. Generics business, we will be recalibrating our investments in R&D significantly and focus on large value-accretive assets. We will share further details on the same in our year- end call in May. On the buildup in the U.S. Specialty business, we will sharpen our focus on setting up an institutional business and Lung Leadership initiative through differentiated assets. As a result of this, we will be focused and out-license our CNS assets in the near term. We are already in discussions with potential partners for the same. In the coming year, FY 21, our P&L spend on U.S. Specialty on total U.S. specialty will be limited to 1% of sales and less than 5% of our total EBITDA, which is roughly similar to the numbers absorbed in the P&L on a YTD basis in our current numbers. In our Emerging Markets business, we will look forward to further consolidate our presence in priority markets and execute in fewer, bigger markets. We will continue to remain focused on establishing our businesses in China, other than the markets of Australia, New Zealand, Algeria, Morocco and some parts of Southeast Asia. In terms of overall capital allocation, going forward, we will continue to invest aggressively in our established branded market franchisees of India and continue our focused investments in February 05, 2020 South Africa, while calibrating our investments in U.S. Generics and in the Specialty business. This will help us drive improvement in the overall ROCE of our business, which, Kedar has already mentioned, has improved significantly in the last 3 years. Finally, in terms of our outlook for the next quarter. As you are aware, quarter 4 will behave in line with historic seasonality and may see sequential moderation in the overall numbers. But on a year-on-year basis, were expecting the momentum to continue in quarter 4 and report yet another healthy quarter for the business. I would like to thank you for your attention and will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

And I think that results in your demand not getting hijacked because of the margin issue that the trade may face. So I think that is the first thing that we are trying to do. And separately, look, weve evaluated the margin risk to us. And I think at where we are today, I think we are quite confident that this can be managed relatively well. There is a risk, but the way we are looking at it, its not a huge risk to our business today.",

And I think the big thing here is that what we are doing in the Rx business is quite interesting. I think, a) its a focused brand strategy. Second, its a strategy also focused on how number of products can improve for prescription. So its about allocating our capital, allocating our effort behind product categories, which can create more February 05, 2020 productivity in the marketplace and not go after every product line etc. So thats one. The second is we are beginning to grow categories. So for example, for us, Respiratory is 1/3 of our business. And the problem with the growth in that business really is that we have to educate people that asthma is curable, that inhalers are absolutely safe. And its not about a Cipla product or otherwise. And thats exactly what weve been doing for the past 2 years through the Berok Zindagi campaign. So its really about creating more patient awareness, more patient centricity, doctor centricity and improving more products per prescription from every doctor. So its about the SFE engine, the sales force effectiveness engine. So its stuff like that, that were trying to do for the Prescription business.",

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen. Good evening to all of you. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and well. We appreciate you joining us today for our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call for Fiscal 2020. I hope you have received the ‘Investor Deck’ that we have posted on the website. Globally and as a country we are going through a health crisis of unprecedented proportions, raising a lot of uncertainties about our operations. Before sharing commentary on the numbers for the quarter, I would like to talk about how we are managing our operations through the pandemic. I am pleased to report that our teams across operations including manufacturing, supply chain, R&D and marketing have demonstrated strong resilience on the back of robust business continuity plans. We did experience some logistics and dispatch challenges towards the end of March. But the situation has significantly stabilized now as we speak. For long-term pandemic preparedness we are proactively de-risking the business with increase in inventory holdings for critical API, intermediates and KSM and adequate levels of finished goods. Our manufacturing facilities are operating at healthy levels with a bit of differing attendance at plants in various parts of the country. We have also temporarily reduced production for some of May 15, 2020 our low margin non-critical products to release manufacturing bandwidth for more critical products. All our product approvals as we speak we do not anticipate any major delays in approvals, but we continue to monitor the same and we will provide update as and when appropriate. In the coming quarters, we will continue to focus on cost optimization and strong cash generation. This FY’20 profit after tax is historically the highest profit after tax for Cipla. And before you make any year-on-year comparisons, you should note that in the previous year we have the contribution of Cinacalcet which is not there in the current year at that level. Coming to the “Quarter.” There are certain items which have impacted our quarterly numbers. These are as follows: Towards the end of the quarter because of the lockdown announcement and related logistics and dispatch challenges, our sales were impacted by almost Rs.200 crores. Most of this sales pertain to our India prescription and emerging market geographies which are very high margin. While this will be recovered in Q1, this has impacted the EBITDA for the quarter by about 200 basis points. Included in the EBITDA is a sizeable cost for Goa remediation when work was fast-tracked and majority of the costs are now already booked and hence we believe the subsequent quarters will not have any major P&L charge. For the quarter, overall income from operations stands at Rs.4,376 crores, recording a YoY 7%. Normalized for contribution from IP-enabled opportunity in US in the base along with strong performance across our branded markets in India and South Africa. As mentioned earlier, the sales for the quarter were impacted by over Rs.200 crores because of COVID-linked dispatch situation. Gross margin after material cost stood at 61.4% for the quarter on a reported basis. Total expenses which include employee cost and other expenses stood at Rs.2,054 crores, increased by 4% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for the quarter stood at Rs.764 crores increasing by 2% versus last quarter. The other expenses which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion are at Rs.1,290 crores, increasing by 6% sequentially largely driven by Goa remediation expenses and other growth-linked investments. Total R&D investment for the quarter are at 7% of revenues. Over the last three to four months, we have seen strong validation and successful execution of high investment, limited competition portfolio with the approval of Albuterol and completion of trials for the generic Advair and filing of another complex inhalation asset. This will result into moderation in our R&D spend in FY’21 as we had guided earlier. Reported EBITDA for the quarter was at Rs.652 crores or 15% to sales. As highlighted earlier, the COVID link cut off has impacted this by about 200 basis points. Tax charge for the quarter stood at Rs.86 crores. In fiscal ’21, we expect tax rate to moderate downwards given the changes in the corporate tax regime. Profit after tax is at Rs.256 crores or 5.6% of sales. During fiscal ’20, we maintain very strong focus on cash generation. We prepaid USD275 million of InvaGen acquisition loan ahead of schedule during the year. Our long-term debt now stands at USD315 million, out of which USD275 million is towards the InvaGen acquisition and ZAR720 million for the Mirren acquisition in South Africa. We also have May 15, 2020 working capital loans of about USD41 million and South African ZAR280 million, which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Total net debt-to-equity is about 0.05 and very healthy. Outstanding forward and option contract with the hedge for receivables as of 31st March 2020 are USD197 million and ZAR510 million. During the quarter we have also hedged certain portion of our forecasted export revenue. Outstanding cash flow hedges as of 31st March are USD121 million and ZAR312 million. From a capital allocation perspective, we have significantly improved our return on invested capital over the last two-three years by almost 300 basis points. We continue to maintain our aggressive investment stance in established branded franchises of India, continued focus investment in South Africa and calibrated investments in US generics and specialty business which will drive further improvement in the return metrics. As I mentioned in the beginning, we will remain focus on ensuring a healthy cash position and reimagining the cost base across our businesses in these times. I would now like to request “Umang to present the Business and Operational Performance.”",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. Before moving to the business update, I would like to start with some thoughts on the COVID-19 pandemic and Cipla’s response. In the wake of the unabated spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cipla has stood strong by India as the country’s oldest pharmaceutical institution. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to healthcare workers on the frontline as well as our employees who have been working relentlessly to deliver on our promise of caring for life. In order to ensure business continuity, we had set up a global task force with a robust contingency plan to safeguard the wellbeing of our employees stationed at our facilities, depots and other offices so as to ensure uninterrupted supply of medication support and care to the patients. We also launched a spate of relief efforts for advanced testing to safeguard healthcare providers and supply communities with medicines, essential hygiene items and food. We had also contributed to the government’s PM CARES Fund. We are pleased to partner with Gilead for Remdesivir. Our partnership with Gilead represents our unwavering commitment to providing patients with access to lifesaving treatment and is a significant step towards saving millions of lives impacted by the pandemic. With that said, let me come to the strategy updates and operational performance for the quarter. I will briefly talk about our outlook at this stage for FY’21 thereafter. Last quarter in India we had announced “One India” strategy which brings together the might of our three businesses. I would like to share some more updates on the same. We are working on some areas to integrate the three businesses which are the Prescription business, the Generic business and our Consumer Wellness business that have converged under the overall “One India” umbrella. We are transferring select brands which have high consumerization potential from trade generics to our consumer business. Some examples include the Prolyte, Maxirich and an entire new range of Mamaxpert. May 15, 2020 We also launched Ciphands Sanitizer under the hygiene category to cater to an emerging consumer need during the early stages of the pandemic. We have also recently launched an “Omnigel Consumer Campaign” where Omnigel which is a generic product is benefiting from the inputs provided by the consumer team in trying to create a new market segment for Omnigel. We are in the process of creating a channel taskforce to deepen channel engagement, investing in strategic partnerships and smart analytics through our entire portfolio and range. We have also improved patient connect through our “Berok Zindagi Campaign” and several other one therapy platforms that we are compensating. Coming to the “Business Performance.” India Rx business delivered its third consecutive quarter of market beating double-digit growth. Chronic therapies ranked #2 driving a significant share of our growth and grew by 12% for IQVIA MAT March 20th broadly in line with the market growth. Cipla continued to maintain its leadership position across Respiratory, Neurology, while maintaining a #3 position in Anti-Infective and #4 in Cardiology. As mentioned by Kedar, the trade generic business continues to drive strong momentum with strong consecutive growth quarter post stabilization of the model change we have implemented in Q1. To further support our domestic business and allocate capital to the India market, Cipla acquired the four umbrella brands in a Nutraceutical segment from Wanbury Limited to further strengthen the four decade long presence they had in the women’s health category. Value-accretive investments like those as well for Elores which is an anti-infective critical care asset and Vyzov which is the DPP-4 inhibitor that we had bought from Novartis are likely to reinforce Cipla’s strong play in key domestic therapeutic segments. In the US Generics segment we optimize the IP-led opportunity in fiscal year ‘20 and scaled our US business significantly. The US business delivered the revenue of US$118 million in the quarter as revenues from the IP-enabled opportunity have normalized and we have taken certain shelf stock adjustments. We also launched Esomeprazole for oral suspension during the quarter with the first-to-file status on the 10 mg strength. From a “Launch Outlook Perspective” the limited competition unlocking has already started with the launch of Esomeprazole and generic Albuterol MDI. Over the rest of the quarters and next, we expect to launch one limited competition asset each amongst the other launches planned in a normal basis. In South Africa and our emerging markets business, the South Africa business delivered strong numbers growing 10% in local currency terms during the quarter. Cipla ranks as the 3rd largest pharmaceutical cooperation within the South Africa private market by both volume and value. May 15, 2020 We are also pleased to share that Cipla emerge to be the largest player in the addressable OTC market and the 3rd largest player in the ARV market in the private side. Other businesses like the sub-Saharan African business were impacted with certain receivables related challenges while the CGA business remained flat for the quarter. Our European operations continued strong in-market performance and grew 14% on a full year basis in US dollar terms. The emerging market business was flat for the quarter on COVID-19 related logistical challenges impacting sales which we hope to recover in Q1. In the US Specialty segment in line with our previously announced strategy of partnering out our CNS assets, we have successfully completed the sub-licensing of our NCE CNS asset to a partner for further development. We are also actively exploring partners for the other CNS assets like the Tizanidine Patch. This strategic de-risking deal has enabled cost recovery, significantly to reduce future R&D payouts while retaining some future upside benefits from successful filings and commercialization. I would like to talk a little about lung leadership there where over the past few years we have invested significantly in lung leadership across our markets. In the US business, we have been creating a sustainable pipeline that offers strong medium to long-term visibility on revenue and profitability. As you know, Cipla has been a leader in the inhalation therapy and the milestones achieved in the last two months are a testament to the strong R&D capabilities in the space. This also marks the successful execution of high investment, limited competition pipeline particularly in the lung leadership and the inhalation space and hence the R&D investments will see moderation to that extent in the coming year. The recent US FDA approval for generic Albuterol MDI and the successful completion of the Phase-III clinical study of generic Advair Diskus reiterates the commitment of strengthening our regulated respiratory franchise. We would also like to share that we have filed another complex inhalation asset recently in the US. And another partnered asset is in late stage clinical trial. I am also delighted to share that according to the latest IQVIA numbers, Cipla is ranked #2 as the largest seller globally for both DPI and MDI devices with more than 120 million units sold globally. As we aspire to become the lung leaders in the world, we are positioning global respiratory efforts under the ‘Breathe. Think Cipla.’ branding. The positioning will bring together an internal task force geared to ensure that we achieve our goal of becoming a global lung leader across our focus markets. I would like to turn to the regulatory section of the analyst call today. On the regulatory front, we are working with the US FDA to comprehensively address the Goa observations. Our last update was submitted to the agency in April end. Over the last 15-months FDA inspections covered most of our facilities outside Goa, where we have already received the EIR for all of May 15, 2020 them. We will continue to provide regular updates on the same in our quarterly communications and continue to remain focused on maintaining the highest standards of quality across our manufacturing network. Turning now to our “Outlook.” We understand the COVID-19 situation is dynamic, but the underlying fundamentals of our business remain extremely strong. While we see some near-term opportunities, positive trends across our backend operations and front-end logistics, we are approaching the coming one or two quarters cautiously as clearer demand patterns emerge from our market. Inspite of the uncertainty, our business teams have actively reimagined their operating models which include aspects such as creating a digital roadmap for the future, optimizing overall resourcing across businesses, speed and agility and making informed choices in areas which matter the most. Managing supply across all key markets is a key priority for us. We have robust plans in place for manufacturing, supply chain, R&D and marketing with a focus on cost optimization and cash management. We are proactively working on ensuring adequate inventory levels for critical raw material and finished goods in the channel. We will scale our India business across the three businesses on the back of “One India” strategy to drive the quality of revenue growth and health metrics. In South Africa, we will continue to maintain leadership positions across both the private and OTC market. And our US generics business shall continue to build upon our respiratory franchise and solidify our position as lung leader globally. We are looking at a healthy launch pipeline for the year and have already seen traction in the last two months with the launch of Albuterol and Esomeprazole for oral suspension. We will also hope to focus on and resolve the regulatory issue at our Goa plant. With this I come to the end of our message. I would like to thank you for your attention and request the moderator to open the session for Q&A. I would like to wish all of you good health in the months ahead.",

The thing with any inhaler that recently gets launched is that you just have to make sure that the scale up happens properly and that is why we had announced a staggered launch because clearly there are multiple parts involved in this starting with the API to the device to everything. So just getting all of that full kitted is I think is important for us and therefore we announced a staggered launch. But, yes, from our perspective, we believe we have adequate capacity to get an adequate share of this market. On the second price point, Nithya, yes, we have seen I would say a little bit of stabilization of prices in the US and in some way maybe a lot of us are also not noticing an adverse environment there because there is just so much more to worry about at this point in time. So, I do think the things have stabilized, but the general trend of a price decrease being there every year will still continue because that is the nature of the US market. But the aggressive declines we saw, I think those are beginning to stabilize. So every year the US market, even before three years or four years back, every year there was a decline in the market. And that trend will continue. I think it got accelerated with the levels which were pretty high which we think now are beginning to stabilize.",

As far as the cash generation is concerned, we have this second installment of IV Tramadol opportunity in the US to be repaid and there is still some long-term loan on the balance sheet. And there are opportunities to deploy in the business both for our branded business and organic capex. We keep looking at our capital allocation and deployment strategy very carefully and we will go by that, Nikhil. I think what we have been doing is that both in the fixed capital and working capital, the optimization efforts have been very significant and we will keep looking at opportunities there in the coming quarters. And yes. I mean every year we have increased RoCE by more than 100, 150 basis points for the last three years and that journey will continue.

This one- off that you referred are a part of the pharma business, once a while inventories that you have tilted as a forward cover, I think once a while it will go for expiry. Nothing to defend the inefficiencies. We will work on it. But I think directionally you should assume that the journey of margin expansion and return expansion will continue.

We appreciate you joining us today for our first quarter earnings call for the fiscal ‘21. I hope you have received the ‘Investor Presentation’ that we have posted on the website. Before I come to the quarter, hope you have had the time to review our recently published integrated annual report for FY’20. This is our third integrated annual report and it significant enhances the quality of our disclosures and presents detailed information on various types of capitals under the sustainability reporting framework. This initiative is in line with our focus on improving transparency, governance and setting best-in-class disclosure practices. Coming to the quarter: While the global pandemic continued largely unabated, impacting demand drivers through the quarter, I am sincerely grateful to our employee’s dedication and perseverance during these uncertain times. With a single-minded focus on ensuring patient access, our teams across manufacturing, supply chain and business and various functions have worked tirelessly. Robust contingency planning has helped us manage our operations and deliver on strategic priorities as August 7, 2020 we transition to post-COVID operating environment. We mobilized significant resources and offer tremendous support for battling COVID with comprehensive product offerings by organic route and through our global partnerships as well. Logistics and distribution have largely normalized now via advanced bookings and close coordination with service providers and port and air authorities to ensure smooth operations. We are also proactively derisking the import dependence on raw materials by developing alternative sources for some of our leading products. Our manufacturing facilities are now operating at healthy levels, with dynamic planning and coordination between procurement and manufacturing supported by strong safety protocols. We have also significantly leveraged digital platforms for smooth engagement with healthcare practitioners and channel partners on a regular basis. For the quarter, despite the continued uncertainty, it saw strong execution across the board and demonstrated the resilience of our operations. We remain strongly anchored to our business reimagination, cost optimization agenda, along with focus on the basics of business including cash and liquidity management. You will notice that these initiatives have translated into a robust performance for the quarter. We are also pleased to report the highest ever quarterly collections, which strengthen our liquidity position significantly and helped achieve a zero-net debt at the end of quarter. Similarly, lower on ground activity and our cost re-imagination initiatives across businesses have led to cost saving which drove the EBITDA margin for the quarter to almost 24%. While the variance in expenses versus last year will be difficult to predict at this stage, but given the strong execution on cost optimization in Q1, we believe our FY’21 operating expense will potentially be lower after absorbing all the COVID-linked escalations by almost Rs.400 crores to Rs.500 crores in the full year as compared to our intended FY’21 operating plans. Coming to the revenue growth. The quarter also witnessed robust performance. Overall, India business which include prescription, trade generics and consumer healthcare grew 16% in the quarter on a YoY basis. Our Prescription business delivered 9% growth led by chronic therapies, which offset the subdued acute therapy demand and gradually recovering base hospital business. The Trade Generics business delivered strong adjusted growth of 46% despite lockdown and impact on the acute business. We continue to make good progress on our “One India” strategy through successful portfolio transition. August 7, 2020 Our private branded market franchise in South Africa grew by 24% in local currency terms year- on-year and continue to outperform the market. The US generics business delivered $135 million of revenue in the quarter supported by ramp- up of Albuterol and other new launches. For the financial performance, we would like to highlight certain specific items which are subsumed in our reported numbers. The contribution of the COVID medicine portfolio in the India Prescription business is marginal for the quarter. Remdesivir sales began in the month of July and hence, Q1 numbers do not include any contribution of Remdesivir. Also, the incremental margin from COVID-linked medicine was fully diverted towards our COVID- related efforts of supporting healthcare providers and frontline workers with PPE and other safety requirements. The expenses for the quarter include COVID linked escalations in material cost, freight and distribution and admin and safety, etc., which have been more than offset by strong optimization. During the quarter, we contributed approximately Rs.18 crores towards COVID relief efforts including employee contribution. Overall income from operations is Rs.4,346 crores, recording a YoY growth of 9%. Gross margin after material cost is at 63.4% for the quarter on a reported basis. The decline on a YoY basis was attributed to contribution of high margin Cinacalcet in last year; however, on a sequential basis, this is almost 200 basis points expansion. Total expenses which include employee cost and other expenses are at Rs.1,708 crores, decreased by 17% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for the quarter is Rs.772 crores, increased marginally by a per cent versus last quarter. Other expenses for this quarter, which includes R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion are at Rs.936 crores. This declined by 27% sequentially largely driven by the optimization initiatives and lower on-ground activity during the lockdown. Total R&D investment for the quarter is Rs.200 crores approximately which is 4.6% of revenue. This is largely due to expected moderation in the R&D post completion of the Advair trials, lower clinical trials and other developmental activities due to the lockdown. Reported EBITDA for the quarter is Rs.1,049 crores, which is 24% to sales. Tax charges at effective rate of 28.5% and we believe the rate for the full year of FY’21 will be in the same range. Profit after tax is Rs.578 crores or 13.3% of sales. For the quarter ending June 2020, our long-term debt now stands at USD 317 million, out of which USD275 million is towards Invagen acquisition and ZAR720 million is for Mirren acquisition in South Africa and other operational requirements. August 7, 2020 We also have working capital loans in rupees, dollars and rand which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Driven by strong focus on cash generation during the quarter, Cipla is now a zero net debt company as on June 2020. Outstanding forward and option contract as a hedge for receivables as of 30th of June are USD217 million and ZAR678 million. During the quarter, we have also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. Outstanding cash flow hedges are USD256 million and ZAR475 million. I would now like to invite “Umang to present the Business and Operational Performance.”",

Before moving to the business and operational updates, I would like to first thank each one of Cipla’s employees, all our vendors, our partners, in order to help us go through the upheaval of the COVID pandemic has resulted in. I would like to share Cipla’s response in battling the COVID pandemic. At Cipla, every one of us has been fortunate to have an opportunity to contribute significantly to a global cause and deliver in our promise of caring for life. Under our partnership with Gilead for Remdesivir, we launched Cipremi in July for India. In India, this product is currently being made available through the government and hospital channels with appropriate safety and regulatory protocols required for distribution. To help patients further, we also started a 24/7 toll free helpline to disseminate safety and procurement information on our high-quality offering which included: Cipremi; Actemra; Imulast which was Hydroxychloroquine; Azithromycin; and Ciphands. Our relentless efforts in supporting severe COVID patients included the supply of 20,000+ vials of Actemra to 150+ government hospitals and institutions. Recently, we have also launched Ciplenza, which is Favipiravir in India to expand our offerings to fight the battle against COVID-19. We continue to engage with physicians through multiple digital touch points and we have retained top of mind recall through these times. We have also contributed significantly to their supplies of PPE and other equipment which is required during COVID. We have also taken several company-level initiatives to ensure employee safety and support to their families. With that, let me come to the “Strategic Updates and Operational Performance for the Quarter.” We commenced this quarter by establishing a strategic task force to deal with the challenges unleashed by the pandemic. Restricted business activity presented us an opportunity to reimagine our business models across multiple dimensions. The performance for the current quarter is an indication of the execution across these initiatives. The sustainability of which we will continue to drive as the trajectory of the pandemic evolves over the subsequent quarters. August 7, 2020 I am extremely pleased to note the effort on cost management resulting in significant spend optimization during the quarter and helping us drive the strong EBITDA that we have reported. In India, despite the COVID-related challenges, the progress on our “One India” strategy that we announced earlier, continue to see seamless execution to integrate the three businesses of Rx, Gx and Consumer. Coming to the business performance, we continued our strong momentum and have reported a market leading growth for the fourth consecutive quarter now. We are confident that the momentum will continue in the quarters to come. India Rx business grew at 9% on a year-on-year basis supported by strong traction in chronic therapies thereby offsetting subdued acute demand due to closure of individual clinics and the impact of slowdown on our hospital portfolio. We continue to deliver market leading growth in respiratory, inhalation and urology despite the lockdown restriction during the quarter as per the IQVIA April to June ‘20 numbers. Cipla ranked #2 in the market share of 7.4% in chronic therapies and grew by 7% as per IQVIA in April to June ‘20, while market grew at 5%. Driven by cost controls and lower on-ground activity during the quarter, the India Rx business saw a significant improvement in the EBITDA margin. The Trade Generics business continued its healthy growth trajectory and delivered another quarter of strong growth despite the lockdown adjusted for the transfers we made to the CHL business. The quality and health of the business has significantly improved as we continue to maintain channel hygiene and improve margins. To further support our domestic business, we recently announced a partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim for three oral anti-diabetic products, which are SGLT2 and DPP4 inhibitors and extended our partnership with Roche for three oncology products, which are Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab and Rituximab. We continue to transition of select high consumerization potential brand from Trade Generics to our CHL franchise. In the current quarter, we successfully transferred two brands - Naselin and Clocip -- from the trade generics business. With this, the total number of products transferred is already five and we are also planning to transfer a few more in the next few quarters. We continue to build on the Ciphands Sanitizer franchise, the new extensions under the hygiene category. We are pleased to announce that Ciphands is now a mature and reliable brand in just three months of launch. Strong execution across all these initiatives helped us drive double-digit revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. August 7, 2020 “US Generics and Lung Leadership.” As you’re aware, our expertise in developing effective therapies for respiratory ailments stems from our lung research over the last six decades. FY’21 marks the successful execution of high investment, limited competition pipeline and a significant growth driver over medium to long-term in the US market. The US generics business delivered $135 million in the quarter supported by a ramp up of Albuterol as well as growth in the base business. In line with our previous commentary on limited competition launches every quarter, we launched our first Dihydroergotamine nasal spray with 180-day CGT exclusivity. We are also pleased to announce another key approval of Icatibant PFS recently. We will continue to maintain this launch momentum in differentiated and limited competition launches over the subsequent quarters. We have accelerated the supply of Albuterol HFA in the US markets and I am pleased to inform that we already have 65% share of the Proventil market in four weeks following the launch as per IQVIA. All major retailers are under coverage for Albuterol HFA. Across the three Albuterol HFA products, which is Proventil, ProAir and Ventolin, Cipla has 6.2% of weekly prescription market share in the total market and 8.3% of weekly prescription market share in the generic market as per IQVIA ending in July 2020. Coming over to our “Emerging Market Businesses and our SAGA Business.” The South Africa private market grew strongly by 24% over Q1 FY’20, and the tender business grew at about 6% in local currency terms. We are pleased to report that Cipla was the fastest growing corporation in the South Africa market with new product launches forming a significant growth driver despite the crisis. Our private branded market franchise in South Africa grew at 6.6% while the market declined by 1.2% as per IQVIA MAT June ‘20. We continue to maintain and solidify our position with the market share of 7.16% as per the IQVIA MAT June ‘20 data. In the OTC space, we grew at 9.3%, while the market declined by 0.5% and maintained and grew our market share of 7.65%. The emerging market business grew 50% year-on-year on Q 1 FY’20 in USD terms supported by strong demand and base effect from the last year. The adjusted growth for the quarter was 10%. The European operations grew 9% year-on-year over Q1 FY’20 in US dollar terms. The European operations were driven by market share gains in flagship respiratory products and key DTMs in direct to market and new introductions. We continue to drive new biosimilar and other partnerships with deals that we have signed for the emerging markets. Coming to the “Regulatory Update.” On the regulatory front, we are working with the US FDA to comprehensively address the Goa observations. Our last and final update was submitted to the agency recently. We will continue to provide regular updates of the same in our quarterly August 7, 2020 communications and continue to remain focused on maintaining the highest standards of quality across our network. Turning to the “Outlook.” We understand that the COVID-19 situation is dynamic. And while the underlying fundamentals of our business remain extremely strong, demonstrated by our performance, we are also cautiously optimistic about the ensuing quarters and what they bring to us. We are navigating the peak phase of the pandemic with sharp rise in infections which threaten the recovering healthcare ecosystem. Supported by the strong back-end operations and the front-end logistics, we continue to approach the coming one to two quarters cautiously as clearer demand pattern emerge from our market. Across our operating geographies, business units are actively reimagining their models to transform in the next avatar. We are witnessing a significant traction against digitally efficient means of engagement which cuts across markets and functions, identifying product market opportunities as a direct, indirect outcome of the pandemic. We are developing and building sustainable leaner models built on a strong cost focus. And there is a fair amount of focus on automation and process simplification that can support more informed decision-making. Balancing growth while maintaining cost leadership is going to be the mantra going forward for our businesses across the world. Our India businesses will scale across the three-pronged strategy of Rx, Gx and CHL. And our One India strategy will continue to drive the quality of revenue growth and health metrics. In South Africa, we will continue to maintain leadership across the private and OTC markets. And on the US generics business, we shall continue to build a respiratory franchise and solidify our position as lung leaders globally. We continue to engage with the USFDA for the approval of the filed Advair product, a partner for an inhalation asset will respond to the FDA letter this year on queries that they had received. We are looking at healthy launch pipeline for the next year and have already seen traction across the recent launches that we have had. We will continue to keep our facilities in a state of compliance and control. I would like to thank you for your attention and will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

But are you able to take market share from the other Albuterol brands? And what is your target market share of the overall Albuterol market? And if you can generally comment on growth outlook for the US? And similarly, on India, I think the growth has been one of the best of 9% in the branded August 7, 2020 market. Do you see this range of antivirals and COVID-related products that you have recently launched will be a meaningful contributor to revenues going forward?",

I think on India, looking at the case load that we are going through as a country, I think that there will be perhaps continued momentum for some of the products that we have been selling. Also, the monsoons here, the rains, though the season is limited, I think there will be a little bit of a viral outbreak as well. So, we are well prepared for the India business. I think we hope to see momentum continue here. Saion, we also had a low base effect for our Rx business last year. So just keep that in mind as well when you look at our results. But overall, I think we see our momentum continuing for the India business. We are seeing a decline in hospital sales and we had a large share of the hospital market. But we are beginning to see that hospital procedures and to some extent surgeries are now coming back possibly not at the same rate that they were before, but I think we see them recovering over a period. So yes, I think Q2 momentum, Q3 momentum in India hopefully should continue. We are working towards that. On the US, the 65% is just the Proventil market share. It is not the total category. But Saion, our belief is that there is a large share of this market that still writes Albuterol generically. And that we do believe that Albuterol as a category and not specifically as a brand substitution is a thesis at play. I cannot give you details on how much volume and our targeted market share, etc., but I believe we have capacity and the cost position to compete in this market.",

So, if I was to look at this last year, Advair itself was almost $30 million plus. And no other asset will come that close to the type of clinical spend that is required. So, it was effectively like running three respiratory programs was the type of effort it took to run the Advair program. So, I think part of what we said was a moderation on account of that which is that, that major spend is away, it has gone now, so, we do not have that in our mix. Other than that, what we have also tweaked is we have tweaked our portfolio a bit to go back to based on how we have made money in the last two or three years in the US to go back to products where we think these opportunities could arise. And so therefore some amount of the tweaking has happened. So, I am not sure that at a point right now where we will broad base expand. But I think we will be very selective going forward because I think the true power of each of the assets, we have is quite significant. The bigger issue for us is to be able to execute this material. Even if we take 12 or 15 assets per year, almost we mix the type of execution we would put in for 30 assets in terms of effort. Because finally even within those 12 to 15, there will be only a few that will deliver meaningful returns.",

I think some of that experimentation has given rise to ideas on how this could or some portion of it could be sustainable going forward to happen let us say digitally. The second thing, maybe I could mention is we are also trying various formats where the reach to doctors can be optimized using digital solutions. So, I think it is a combination of both, Anubhav. There are multiple things that are being tried. Some of these will stick. Some will not stick. For example, we have a relatively large organization in India. We have almost 8,000, 9,000 people on the field.

I think some portion of the could be exception, but we are hoping to see very high senior or double-digit growth for our private market there as well, right. But I think this quarter is slightly more because I think there might have been a base effect over the last year. But also, the other thing that is happening with the health authority there, the SAHPRA, is that they are also trying to expedite approvals for a lot of the products and they are running a program which is trying to get more and more products approved which were backlogged earlier. So, I think we are hopefully also going to benefit with that.",

And we also as you know have IV Tramadol to plan for. So, I think between both the R&D funding and use of cash, we have enough for the foreseeable future. And as you know during the COVID times, the definition of what is excess cash itself gets changed. I think we must have some buffers. So, we will plan for and we will think for what the best use is, but between organic CAPEX, between the R&D and some of the dividend and other items, I think as of now probably we are set. But as we start the next year, I think we will have to just see how we think of some of these matters.",

If you remember, a year back, I think there was a noise about genericizing and trade margin capping and various things that we will have to keep watching how do those things progress. But I think while all that is being sorted out to preserve and grow some of the portfolio of trade generics business which is amenable for consumerization. I think that was a great lever for us to create value. So, I think it will achieve all the objectives that in fact you referred to. So firstly, I think creating stickiness and creating more consumer-led demand algorithm rather than probably a channel-led demand algorithm. That is one. And secondly, backed up by that a little bit of pricing premium, a little bit of stickiness and predictability of demand pattern and associated enhancement in gross margin. Now this obviously would not happen in a month or a quarter, but it will take time. But whatever shifts have happened, we are seeing healthy ratios of stickiness, we are seeing healthy ratios of August 7, 2020 customer acceptance and all these metrics of consumerization that one could track based on market status, those are looking quite healthy.",

We appreciate you joining us today for our second quarter earnings call for FY’21. I hope you have received the “Investor Presentation” that we have posted on our website. Resilient operations and focused execution of strategic priority was the highlight for the quarter. We continue to applaud our employee’s dedication and persuasions during these uncertain times. We are privileged to have served the patients in India with our India and global markets with our in-licensed and organic product offerings in battling COVID-19. Dynamic capacity planning and coordination between procurement, manufacturing and logistics teams have enabled us to continue uninterrupted supply of medicines to our global markets. We continue to support our business partners via various initiatives and further deepen our digital ecosystem across businesses. Coming to the quarter, we saw strong execution across the board, demonstrating good demand levers across geographies. As we had highlighted in the Q1 call, we have been also able to sustain a good share of cost optimization in Q2. We have also continued the focus on cash management November 06, 2020 leading to healthy balances at the end of the quarter. Our business and cost reimagination initiatives and rigor on operational excellence continue to drive robust performance. We are pleased to report EBITDA margin of 23.4% for the quarter. While some proportion of costs linked to resuming on-ground activity has come back, we have been able to retain a good share on account of digital and efficiency initiatives. Our operating expenses continue to track a bit higher than the optimization potential of Rs.400 crores to Rs.500 crores against our FY’21 operating plans that we referred to in the last call. In the coming quarters, we will also be investing in growth-linked initiatives such as “Berok Zindagi 3.0 Campaign” and other campaigns for consumer health products. Coming to growth for the quarter, the overall revenue grew by 15% on a year-on-year basis. Overall India business which include prescription, trade generics and consumer business grew 17% on a year-on-year basis. The India Prescription business delivered 14% growth on a year- on-year led by COVID portfolio, traction in chronic therapies, coupled with the recovering hospital business partially offset by subdued seasonal triggers on the acute side. The Trade Generics business delivered healthy growth for the quarter driven by strong demand and high order flow. Overall, our “One India Strategy” continues to be on track. Private branded market franchise in South Africa grew by 9% on year-on-year business in local currency and outperformed the market very significantly. The Tender business also delivered very healthy growth of 28% on a year-on-year basis. The US Generics business delivered USD141 million in the quarter supported by continued momentum in the new launches which include Albuterol. We are pleased to report that the US business is trending very close to company level profitability in the first half of FY’21. Despite the contribution of Cinacalcet in Q2 of last year, we have seen very healthy and sustainable expansion of US EBITDA margin in this quarter. Coming to the “Financial Performance” we would like to highlight certain specific items which is subsumed in our numbers. At a company level in the first half, the contribution from COVID portfolio was less than 5% of the revenues and EBITDA. As you are aware, there is a cap on the MEIS export incentives reimbursement scheme and we have strong growth levers across businesses that will help offset this impact. For the quarter, overall income from operations is Rs.5,038 crores. Gross margin after material cost stood at 61.4% for the quarter on a reported basis. The decline on a year-on-year basis is November 06, 2020 attributable more to the contribution of high margin Cinacalcet last year; however, on a sequential basis there was 200 basis points decline largely due to the change in product mix. Total expenses which include employee cost and other expenses stood at Rs.1,915 crores, increased by 12% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for the quarters stood at Rs.821 crores, increased by 6% driven by the increments that were announced w.e.f. from July. The other expenses for this quarter which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing expense and sales promotion stood at Rs.1,095 crores, increasing by 17% sequentially. This was driven by normalizing on-ground activity which is sales linked, offset by strong cost optimization and digital initiatives. Total R&D investment for the quarter stood at Rs.226 crores, while the percentage to sales appears a bit lower, part of that is on account of healthy revenue growth, accompanied by last year Advair spends in the base. All priority projects are on track and we expect R&D spends to increase as the respiratory assets progress in clinical trials. Reported EBITDA for the quarter Rs.1,177 crores which is 23.4% percent of sales. Tax charge is at an effective rate of 28.5% and the annual ETR is expected to be in the same range. Profit after tax is Rs.665 crores or 13.2% of sales. As of 30th September, our long-term debt stands at USD275 million, is largely towards our InvaGen acquisition in the US and ZAR720 million for Mirren business acquisition and other operational requirements at the South African subsidiary. Working capital loan stood at Rs.300 crores in India, about USD51 billion and ZAR342 million which act has natural hedges towards our receivables. Driven by very strong focus on cash generation, we continue to be a net cash positive company as on September-end. Outstanding derivatives as a hedge for receivables as on 30th September are USD210 million and ZAR660 million. We have also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. Outstanding cash flow hedges as of 30th September are USD179 million and ZAR435 million. I would now like to request “Umang to present the Business and Operational Performance.”",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. I hope everyone is well on the call. And before moving to the “Business and Operational Updates”, I would like to thank our employees for the relentless commitment and perseverance during these uncertain times. I would like to start by sharing Cipla’s continued response in battling the COVID-19 pandemic. We have continued to face the uncertainties of the pandemic with strength, determination, November 06, 2020 confidence and strong patient focus to deliver what matters the most which is our ethos of “Caring for Life.” We serve more than 1.5 lakh severe COVID-19 patients with our portfolio breadth of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Favipiravir. While our 24x7 toll free helpline offered support for COVID-19 treatment products to more than 95,000 patients, we have also offered support for post-recovery of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. Under the partnership with ICMR and NIV, we are also pleased to share that we have launched ELIFast which is a diagnostic kit for the detection of IgG antibody, against SARSCoV-2 which is COVID-19 in the receiving plasma of the patient. We will be supplementing this with new launches in the diagnostic space for COVID as well. We have successfully implemented several business reimagination initiatives such as enabling teleconsult, virtual conferences, remote e-tailing and tools to improve diagnosis and treatment for physicians in a digital environment. Ensuring the safety of our employees and well-being, continues to be the top priority for us as a company. With that let me come to the “Strategic Updates” and the “Operational Performance for the Quarter.” The strong performance for the current quarter is a culmination of relentless execution on several business and cost reimagination programs that we initiated at the onset of the pandemic. I am pleased to see the continued effort on cost management resulting in a significant optimization during the quarter and helping us drive the strong EBITDA margins that we have reported. In India, despite the COVID-related challenges, our “One India Strategy” continues to see seamless execution. Coming to our “Business Performance in India” we continued a strong momentum and have reported market beating growth now for the fifth consecutive quarter. India Prescription business grew 14% on a year-on-year basis supported by continued traction in the COVID portfolio of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Favipiravir along with a regular core growth in the rest of the portfolio. The quarter also saw traction in chronic therapies and modest recovery in the hospital portfolio which offset the subdued demand in our acute business. As per IQVIA, July to September-20, we continued to deliver market beating growth in respiratory where we were 29% versus the (-3%). In the Inhalation segment we were 10% versus a market of 7%. And in Urology where we were 6% versus 3% as the lockdown restrictions continue to ease during the quarter. Cipla ranked #2 with the market share of 7.6% in chronic therapies and grew by 9%. November 06, 2020 We are confident that the momentum will continue in the quarters as we have outperformed the market across several therapies on a sequential basis. We are also excited to launch Berok Zindagi 3.0, Cipla’s flagship for patient focus respiratory initiative on a digital platform. The Trade Generics business continued its healthy growth. The quality and health of the business has significantly improved, led by strengthened hygiene, strong governance and review mechanisms leading to healthy traction in margins. In our Consumer Healthcare business, we are happy to see the scale of roughly around Rs.180 crores in H1 of FY’21. This includes a sanitizer sale which may not continue at the same level. We see strong traction with our consumer brands post transfer from the trade generics business. We will continue to watch the evolving volume growth patterns in our core therapies as demand levers stabilize in the common quarters. Coming to our “US Generics and Lung Leadership Update.” The US Generics business delivered 141 million in the quarter, supported by continued traction in new launches of Albuterol, Esomeprazole oral suspension, the DHE Nasal Spray and these are supporting the base business growth. In line with our commentary on limited competition launches, we launched Dimethyl Fumarate in Q2. We expect the momentum on new launches to continue. We have maintained robust supply of Albuterol HFA in the US and pleased to inform that we have the prescription share of 84% of the Proventil market now as per IQVIA week ending 2nd October. Across the three Albuterol products of Proventil, ProAir and Ventolin, we have over 8% of weekly TRX market share in the total market and over 11% of the generic market. We continue to monitor our market share given the evolving competitive landscape in the larger Albuterol market. Our respiratory pipeline which includes Generic Advair and other complex inhalation assets is progressing well. On a first half basis, the US business is now trending close to company level profitability. The business has seen healthy and sustainable margin expansion over last year despite the contribution of Cinacalcet in the base numbers of the last year. Coming to our “SAGA” which is a South Africa and Global Access business and the emerging market, the South Africa private business delivered strong growth of 9% in local currency over Q2 last year while the Tender business grew by 28% in local currency terms. We are pleased to report that Cipla was the fastest growing corporation in the South Africa private market with new product launches forming a significant growth driver. We maintain a market share of 7% November 06, 2020 as per IQVIA MAT September ‘20. In the OTC space, we grew by 8.2% and maintained a strong market share of 7.2%. We also entered into an exclusive partnership with Alvotech for their commercialization of five biosimilar candidates in immunology and oncology. The emerging markets business has performed as per expectations and maintain scale on a year- on-year basis in US dollar terms driven by demand across all regions. The European operations grew 24% year-on-year. The growth was driven by strong in-market performance and market share gains in key direct-to-market businesses. We are happy to report that Remdesivir supplies have commenced for multiple emerging markets. On a specialty front, through our associate Avenue Therapeutics, we will continue to engage with the USFDA to understand the observations on the CRL for IV Tramadol. We will continue to evaluate multiple options to structure our specialty investment and also further the progress of this asset with the FDA In regulatory, we have submitted our last response to the USFDA regarding our Goa site and we will continue to engage with the agency to comprehensively address the observations. Turning now to our “Outlook,” we continue to monitor the evolving demand patterns across our businesses. We believe the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong which along with the operational agility has helped the company deliver a resilient performance enhancement. We will continue to transform healthcare delivery for physicians and patients from digital platforms and we are tracking our productivity metrics in the progress of our product pipeline. Our priorities for the second half of the year include • Strong governance around the safety, supply security, cost control and working capital management, • Scaling up our businesses across branded and generic markets of India, South Africa, US and emerging markets • Prioritizing key launches with focused execution in collaboration with regulatory authority • Continuing to operate our facilities globally with the highest levels of compliance and control • Constantly building capabilities and talent for transformational business outcomes • Turning adversity into an opportunity by continued focus on digital adoption and cost reimagination across our businesses. With this I would like to thank you for your attention. I wish you and your family well and will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

And the supply for COVID medicines is here to stay and like what Umang alluded, in addition to one site which is captive, now we have two outsource sites and we continue to scale up manufacturing and supply for Remdesivir, and that is here to stay. In terms of margins, actually the margins of prescription business and generics business have gone up year-on-year. So our gross margin for most of the businesses on a year-on-year basis have gone up which is quite healthy. So I think mix is the only thing that we have to watch for. Otherwise there is nothing adverse, the pricing continue strong, the work on cost reduction continue strong, except COVID, I think the mix is good as well.",

So I think there has been a big uptick on account of Albuterol, but just specific on this, in as much as we think that there are only two generic players, there are seven competitors in the Albuterol market, there are three AGs, there are two brands and then there are two generics; now one generic has just exited, right. So if you look at it there are seven players in this market. And I think one has to also understand our market in that perspective. Having said that it is a 65 million unit market which is a very big market. So I just like to say that if we were to look at the overall capacity, yes, we have capacity to go up to 20% to 25%. Would we want to go there is a question at some point in time that we will obviously answer over a period. Now, of course, there is enough flex to be able to reach a certain level of targeted share that we want to get to, but it is not something where we want to build it overnight. I think that we are pretty clear about because what we are also very clear out of our experience of running respiratory products in the rest of the world is that I think the sustainability of your supply in your product is more important than just how quickly you reach a targeted share and frankly there is enough value in this market to do it over a quarter or two quarters.

So I do not want to hazard a guess on how much mix will be there for COVID and non-COVID but as I said excluding COVID, most of the businesses, if not all, have seen a significant gross margin improvement on a YoY basis. And that is based on the mix in those part of the businesses as well as pricing levers as well as cost containment levers. I think all these levers have played out and I think those will continue in the balance of the year in the second half as well.

While we are keen to engage with the street on a basis which is quite candid and transparent, I think we are also conscious that multiple granular numbers do not help beyond a point. So I think suffice to say that COVID is an important part of the portfolio, but it is not that the whole growth and the whole profitability improvement has come from that portfolio. Currently the COVID portfolio is split into India and emerging markets, the international business and the promise to grow exists in both these territories and going forward some of the other therapies which had an impact such as acute I think they will shape up as well. So I think the way our revenue trajectory and profitability trajectory would shape up in the coming periods, will depend upon how we are able to influence the growth of other therapies which have seen a little bit of operation now. We are confident November 06, 2020 because a lot of customer actions and a lot of field action is going on there as well. So that would shape up positively and this in our view also there is lots to play here on the COVID side.",

      "content": "Thank you, Neha, and welcome all of us, everyone on the call today. I know that these are better times. We have really had better times, where we could meet in person, but Im happy to take you through the Cipla story over the last two to three years, and what were looking forward to in the future. I think the slide decks are with all of you, Im just going to call out the first slide is the slide, which is about Cipla, when it was established. Just a quick summary for people who dont know too much about Cipla. Were the second largest company that sells inhalers in the world. Were the second largest company with revenues in India. We are the 3rd largest in South Africa, and 10th largest by prescriptions in the US. We also export out of India to emerging markets. We are the largest Indian exporter to the emerging markets. That is a quick snapshot of Cipla. If you would go to the next slide, this is really a reflection of the numbers. The slide is about our EBITDA and our financial metrics. You can clearly see that in the last three to four years, theres been a pretty robust expansion of both, the EBITDA percentages, the net debt. Essentially, we are now a cash-positive company and a very meaningful expansion in the ROIC. I think a lot of this has come out of focus on execution. It has come about making the right choices about markets and geographies that we invest in as well as a couple of decisions regarding how we treat innovation, and how much we can fund it. Thats really the snapshot of the financial performance over the past couple of years at Cipla. We are really proud to make sure that we live our credo of caring for life. What weve been able to do with COVID by introducing various therapies, being the first to bring remdesivir into India, being the first to launch the entire COVID portfolio range, as well as making sure that, in our factories, our employees, our partners and associate companies are safe. Heartfelt thanks to all, each and every one of Cipla employees for making sure that the company continued to progress during the whole COVID crisis. That was slide three. If you go to slide four, and Ill come back to the slide right at the end of the presentation, this slide is a snapshot of what we believe are our areas that Cipla is going to develop, areas where we believe there will be tremendous value creation. If you look at this, right at the top is our long leadership aspiration. We are number two in a set of players who sells devices. GSK has that position at number one. We would like to attain that leadership. We are humble about it. Its not something that will happen in a years time. I think were well underway into getting into that ambition. This will also mean we will launch new innovative products with our own respiratory capability, technology and devices. A part of this story is also about unlocking the story of complex generics in the US. Respiratory is a big part and a big pillar of that. Well talk a little bit about US on the next slide. Were also trying to make sure that we deliver market beating growth in all the key geographies. You saw number two position by revenue in India, the number three position in South Africa. All of this has happened because were growing faster than market. We continue to intend to do so. Weve also got several markets in the emerging side of the world, where we have pretty dominant positions in terms of market. The focus on execution gets combined with market leadership and execution in market to deliver superior returns. Were also beginning to lay the blueprint of getting into certain new geographies where we think our advantage in being able to bring respiratory technology will play out well. Those two markets are China, where we are actually building a site, as well as in Brazil, where our strategy is a little bit more institutional in terms of specialty injectables as well as some other products. Weve seen, in the last 10 months, an acceleration on how digital can change business models. Its still early days, but we hope to make this a part of our strategy. Therefore, we think there is a fair amount of unlocking that can happen through the introduction, the digitization of processes, and the introduction of digital in the way that the company works. Were certainly trying to take that even further. Of course, we want to make sure we have very strong compliance. We have a very strong blueprint for making sure that our ESG scores improve overtime, and that we leave the planet to be a better planet than what we inherited. Of course, all of this is going to result in a consistent expansion in ROIC. Like weve seen in the past, we hope to replicate some of this in the future. At the end of the presentation, Ill come back summarizing some of these themes. I think the next slide is about our US business. This might be slide five or six in your presentation deck. Were really excited about the prospect of being able to add almost $300 to $500 million of revenue, and our size of somewhere between $500 to $600 million, this is fairly significant. This basically indicates that over the next three to four years, we would be doubling our footprint in the US. This is going to come out of obviously the inhaler and the respiratory franchise, but weve also got some nice partnerships and products fairly in development on the peptide injectable space as well as what comes out through IP challenges, some of which we have demonstrated in the past of being able to unlock like cinacalcet and several others. We see a lot of synergy. Theres a huge focus on execution. All of this can go away if the execution is not right. Thats what were focused on in being able to drive this growth. On the next slide, again talking about the US, youll be able to see that the pipelines nicely diversified from what was earlier focused on oral solid to now focus on respiratory combined with oral solid. Weve got about 30 percent of our portfolio already, which is in respiratory and injectables. Thats only going to increase further as we go. Weve seen respiratory sales up, increased, and youll see that on the slide. Weve seen a 20 percent CAGR in the last three to four years. This will probably only go higher as we introduce new assets. Weve got eight products under development on the respiratory side, two of which are going to get into clinics very shortly. I can come back to the US later. If anyone has any doubts, then feel free to reach out to us. Were very excited about this opportunity. Coming back to our largest market, which is our India market, and we have three businesses servicing the market. We have a consumer business that services it. We have a prescription business, which is our largest. We have the generic business, which is number one in India. I think the beauty is that all these three businesses combined synergistically in terms of being able to offer right portfolio, in being able to offer the clout that we can bring in distribution, as well as taking the access card, going deeper and penetrating deeper into India. Thats what our One India strategy is about. The One India strategy is really about trying to grow the chronic franchisees faster. Its about trying to consumerize our businesses in India, which has the potential to consumerize as well as trying to grow this disproportionately faster with the right focus on productivity and EBITDA. Thats our entire One India strategy. Weve already seen an expansion of almost 300 to 500 basis points on EBITDA in the entire One India framework, as well as were beginning to see synergies across the three businesses as brands move from our generics business to our consumer business. If you go to the next slide, were talking about a prescription business. In the prescription business, as you can see, we enjoy leadership positions in the asthma inhalation space, in Urology. We are now number four in cardiology trying to expand that even faster. Among the chronic categories in IPM, we hold the rank of number two. Its a relatively strong business. The business should grow faster. We have 19 brands among the top 300, and good brand franchises with revenue potential, revenues in India. When they cross 100 crore, which is roughly close to $15 million, theyre considered big brands. We certainly have a fair number of them. Were trying to expand up that in portfolio. This is the mother business of Cipla. The goal is to keep beating market growth here and if you look at the business in totality. On the next slide, were talking about a wellness aspiration. A large part of this wellness aspiration is being able to consumerize parts of our business, like the vitamin segment, the pain segment, like a segment, which is around lozenges, which lend themselves to consumerization. Its our goal that, at Cipla today, the consumer side of our business is today less than five percent. We want to make this almost 12 to 15 percent in the next three to five years. I think thats our goal. These businesses typically are more sticky. They create more value. Multiple transitions are fairly significant in the businesses here. We have this aspiration for India as well as for South Africa. In India, the business is growing at 30 percent. Its already almost $50 million plus on size. Were hoping to take this much bigger as we will in South Africa as well, which is the second place where we have a very solid consumer business. Trading a consumer potential in a business is a strategic aspiration for Cipla. Were well underway into doing that. The next slide is really about generic and the consumer business. Weve spoken a little bit about this, but I think one of the things that is important to highlight is how our brands have shifted from one business to the other. Our consumer business today sells almost Id like to believe 6 brands that have shifted and eventually well sell close to 12 brands that would shift. This would add tremendous clout in our ability to scale the consumer business going forward. The next slide is about our South Africa and the Global Access business. We call it SAGA. SAGA, as you can see, this is a really strong business, probably growing more than 40 quarters higher than market. Were at rank three here. I think Aspen and Adcock are number one and two. Were number three. Were growing relatively fast. I can see leadership positions in respiratory and CNS, number two positions clearly in cardiology and some of the other therapies that are listed on the slide. We expect to continue to grow above market growth. The target is take that growth almost 200-300 basis points higher. We have a nice advantage portfolio in HIV, and the rest of the portfolio. Thatll lend to SAGA being a very significant portion of our business. Coming to the next leg of our business, which is emerging markets in EU. Again, the focus on creating two new markets, but also growing the depth of our business. Weve got solid partnerships here. We operate in almost 60 markets. The focus is really trying to develop these markets going forward. We believe this forms a nice hedge to our businesses and offers a great diversification slate for our businesses across the world. Digital has been a very strong part of our story in the last 12 months. Weve several digital initiatives ongoing. There are initiatives which basically start from how people are inducted into the organization, all the way into automation, quality in manufacturing and the digitization of data, as well as outreach initiatives to patients. We believe that digital story can unlock significant potential in terms of the business profitability going forward. Its early days, but weve tried to set up a transformation office. We have a digital advisory board, and we are well underway into this journey. Wed like to reimagine our business being more digital in the future. We hope that the entire industry changes in the segment. Compliance is integral to us. Were talking about this in the next slide. You can clearly see were audited by several authorities. We also have several facilities that have, of course, the last year has been one where the FDA has not visited. Weve been under the scrutiny of compliance through various audits by various authorities. Our record has been satisfactory. Of course, we have one site, which is under a warning letter, which were hoping to remediate as soon as the COVID restrictions lift. ESG, its compliance and governance is a very strong part of what Cipla does. Weve been winning some awards on the integrated reporting that weve done. This is also getting recognized through the various governance initiatives and the amount that the board is putting together in trying to make Cipla more well governed organization in the past three to five years, and will continue in the future. Our ESG map is very clear, that by 2025, we want to be a company that is carbon neutral, we want to be water neutral. We want to have zero waste to landfill and also try stewardship in anti- microbial as well as making sure that safety is the top of the entire agenda for the company. If you look at what were looking forward to, of course, the ROIC expansion should continue. Weve seen a bump up in this year, but our long-term target is to stay in the 17 to 20 percent range, which is quite significant. If you look at where we were a couple of years back, we were about seven or eight percent. I think theres been strong movement here. Cost controls are important in the businesses being exercised as well as trying to look at the right decisions from a capital allocation and capital strategy mix. Im coming to the last slide, which is were recapping our priorities. Its really about expanding in the lung leadership area, trying to become the number one seller of devices across the world, offering new innovative solutions in the lung space. This is a science that Cipla knows relatively well and through this maximizing the value of opportunity in the US. The second is obviously maintain market beating growth in India and South Africa, grow above market, also create a consumer business that can to be 12 to 15 percent of our overall revenues in the markets of India and South Africa. Create an execution model for our emerging markets business, where we believe that we would be able to take this business significantly higher and offers a great diversification thesis to our story as well. As well as move the needle on digital, create more productivity in the organization, more profitability, continue to stay high on compliance and lead to ROIC expansion of about 300 basis. That is what I wanted to tell you in a summary and a snapshot. Thank you for taking time and being with us, and being part of the Cipla story.",

We have a nice selection of four or five key injectables that we think would create value in the long term.

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen. Good evening to all of you. I hope that all of you and you are families are safe and well. We appreciate you joining us today for our third quarter earnings call for financial year 2021. I hope you have received the Investor Presentation that we have posted on our website. From the calendar year 2020 till now, while the uncertainties and challenges continue to evolve, we achieved several milestones across multiple strategic areas such as servicing demand across global markets, continued portfolio expansion along with resilience in our manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure. And this continued during the December quarter as well with a strong and robust performance. We are pleased to report EBITDA margin of 24.8% for the quarter, which is the highest ever reported EBITDA for the company in the recent history. While on-ground field activity has largely resumed, we have been able to maintain a tight control on the cost base on account of our balanced mix of digital initiatives and face-to-face engagements. Optimization of our FY21 operating expenses continues to track far higher than the potential of Rs. 400 crore to Rs. 500 crore against our operating plan that we have referred to in our earlier quarterly interactions. January 29, 2021 Our free cash generation continues to be robust enabling us to prepay our debt obligations. We repaid $137.5 million of InvaGen acquisition loan during this quarter, which was due several months later. We’ve also repaid working capital loans of Rs. 300 crore in India during this quarter. Our return on invested capital has seen expansion by about 900 basis points over the last nine months, driven by our focus on growth, margin expansion, coupled with cost discipline. While part of this expansion is attributable to some levers which may not always sustain fully in the coming year, this puts us on an accelerated journey towards achieving a sustainable range of 17% to 20% over the long term which is our aspiration. We’re constantly simplifying our manufacturing network to unblock capacities and improve operational efficiency. In line with the same objective, we have divested our manufacturing facility located in Satara, India with an agreement to ensure there is no disruption in supplies. Furthering our commitment to carbon neutrality, which is one of our 2025 sustainability goals, we’re pleased to share that we are the first pharmaceutical company in Maharashtra to commission a large open access solar power plant of 30 megawatt capacity in partnership under group captive scheme. This project is also a testament to our relentless commitment to use cleaner and renewable sources of energy and contributing towards a greener environment. Coming to the financial performance for the quarter: The EBITDA for the quarter includes the benefit of COVID product sales, tender supplies in our Global Access business, litigation settlement and cost optimization. Some of this may not sustain in the coming quarters. In line with sharp reduction in COVID-19 cases in India, which was anticipated, the contribution of COVID products in the overall mix is normalizing on a quarter- to-quarter basis. And the recovery trend in core therapies has helped offset the impact on revenues and profitability. Overall income from operations for the quarter is 5,169 crores which recorded a year-on-year growth of 18% driven by focused execution and demand-led growth across our businesses. All the three businesses under our One India, which is Prescription, Trade Generics and Consumer Health have performed quite well for the quarter with overall, the strategy progressing well. The U.S Generics business continues to exhibit strong momentum supported by new launches including Albuterol. In other businesses such as SAGA, EMEU and API, the performance also was robust. Gross margin stood at 61.4% on a reported basis. There is a marginal decline of 93 bps on a Y- o-Y while on a Q-on-Q it’s flat. The Y-o-Y decline is attributed to sharp reduction in MEIS’s income and contribution of COVID products having lower than company average gross margin in the overall mix. Total expenses, which include employee cost and other expenses are at 1,944 crores, increased by a margin of 2% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for the quarter are at 844 crores, January 29, 2021 increased by 2.9%, largely by increments. The other expenses, which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion are at 1,100 crores, increased marginally and continue to be benefited by cost control and digital engagements. The R&D expenditures include depreciation worth 221 crores, or 4.3% of the revenues. While the percentage to sales appears low, part of that is on account of healthy revenue growth accompanied by last year’s Advair spend in the base. We do not foresee much delay in our priority projects. We expect the spends to increase as the respiratory assets progress in the clinical trials. Overall reported EBITDA for the quarter was Rs. 1,281 crores, or 24.8% of sales. Tax charge is at 269 crores and the effective tax rate has been reduced to 26.3%. We are looking at a full-year ETR of 27.5%. Profit after tax stood at Rs. 748 crores or 14.5% of sales. As of 31st December 2020, our long-term debt stands at US $138 million towards the U.S. acquisition and ZAR720 million for the Mirren acquisition and other operational requirements at South Africa. We repaid working capital loan of Rs. 300 crores in India, as I mentioned. We also have loans of US$41 million and ZAR285 million which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Driven by relentless focus on cash generation, we continue to be a net cash positive company as on December end. Our outstanding derivatives has a hedge for receivables as of 31st December are US$172 million and ZAR705 million. We do also have hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues and the outstanding cash flow hedges are at US$192 million and ZAR403 million. Today, the Board also announced approval for a scheme of arrangement that needs to be filed with multiple regulatory authorities, including stock exchanges, SEBI, NCLT and others. This simplifies our group structure with subsidiarization of our India-based U.S. undertaking to drive further growth and transfer of consumer business undertaking to Cipla Health Limited, in line with our One India strategy. I would now like to invite Umang to present the business and operational performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. Before moving to business and operational updates, I would like to thank our employees for their resolve amidst the challenging and uncertain phases of the pandemic. We’ve delivered on our ethos of Caring for Life. I found inspiration in their acts of courage and commitment. I would like to start by sharing Cipla’s continued commitment to offer a comprehensive portfolio of products for battling the pandemic. We have served more than 4 lakh severe COVID-19 patients with our portfolio breadth of Cipremi, Actemra and Ciplenza. We’ve also supplied Remdesivir to other emerging market countries, including South Africa. We have now enhanced our COVID-19 diagnostic franchise with Covi-G rapid antibody detection under partnership for emerging markets in Europe. We’ve also launched a rapid antigen detection test under partnership for the India market. January 29, 2021 While nearly a large portion of our field force have resumed activity, we continue to leverage teleconsultations, virtual conferences and remote detailing for physicians. We are implementing a hybrid return to office approach for all our associates and have offered the choice to work from anywhere between home and office under most stringent protocols that ensures a safer workplace. With that, let me come to the strategic updates and operational performance for the quarter. Over the last five years, we have taken concrete initiatives to drive focused execution of our strategy, capital allocation, portfolio development, talent and governance. The pandemic significantly accelerated several business and cost reimagination programs, translating into quarters of strong performance. I’m pleased to see this continued effort on cost management and productivity during the quarter, helping us drive revenue growth and EBITDA higher than expectations. In India, our One India Strategy continues to see seamless execution. We continued the momentum in our Prescription business and have reported market-beating growth for the sixth consecutive quarter now. Prescription business grew at 25% on a year-on-year basis, led by contributions from the COVID portfolio, healthy traction in respiratory and chronic therapies, recovery in the hospital and acute businesses with the opening up of several OPDs. As per IQVIA October-December ’20 quarter we continued to deliver market-beating growth in Respiratory where we were 14% versus the minus 4% in the market, Urology 8% versus a 7% and Derma 15% versus 8%. Cipla ranked number two with a market share of 8.1% in chronic therapies, and grew by 6% in the chronic therapies. We’re pleased to inform that Berok Zindagi 3.0, Cipla’s flagship respiratory initiative was viewed by already 9 crore people across India reflecting the power of digital reach. The Trade Generics business grew by 7% adjusted for branch transition to Consumer Health businesses. The business witnessed healthy seasonal demand across regions. Our Consumer Health business has now scaled up to 250 crores-plus revenue in nine months, led by growth in organic, as well as continued traction in our consumer brands, post transfer from the Trade Generics business. Coming to the U.S. Generics, the U.S. Generics business grew by 6% to US $141 million in the quarter, supported by continued traction in the new launches, as well as growth in the institutional channels supporting the business. On a nine-month FY21 basis, the U.S. business continues to deliver robust profitability. We have consistently managed the supply of Albuterol HFA in the U.S., and I’m pleased to inform you that we are ranked number one in the Proventil market with 84.6% share. The overall Albuterol market as per the latest data, we are trending closer to 14% market share. This unlocking has enabled our U.S. respiratory franchise to cross $100 million in the nine months of fiscal year ’21. Our respiratory asset generic Advair is under active review and we’re constantly engaging with the agency. We will have two complex assets in the respiratory space that we will move into January 29, 2021 clinical trials shortly. On the complex generics side, the settlement of generic Revlimid improves the earnings visibility and enhances our U.S. product portfolio towards complex products in addition to our respiratory franchise. Coming to South Africa and emerging markets. While sales in South Africa private business were in line with last year for the quarter, a nine-month growth remains strong at 11% year-on- year in local currency terms. Cipla continues to maintain its third position with a market share of 7% and is growing faster than the market. In the OTC space, we grew at 6% where the market grew by 3% and we ranked third overall in the OTC market. Overall, the SAGA region grew by 6% in U.S. dollar terms, supported by solid performances in the Sub-Saharan and our Tender Access CGA business with 15% and 63% growth on a year-on-year basis. During this quarter, we also entered a strategic partnership with Alvogen for four oncology products, which will enhance our oncology presence over the long term. The emerging markets business grew by 46% on a year-on-year basis in U.S. dollar terms, driven by continued demand across all regions. We are pleased to share that Cipla is the largest Indian exporter to emerging markets as per the IntelliMax for the period April to November. The European operations grew 28% driven by consistent end market performance and market share gains in some of our key direct market businesses. Our flagship respiratory products continue to demand double-digit market share. Our API business grew by 18% on a year-on-year basis with seamless execution of order book and customer relationships. On the regulatory front, we are actively engaged with the agency and working towards the resolution of observations for our Goa plant. Turning now to our outlook. We are encouraged by the agility and responsiveness demonstrated by the business units across the Cipla geographies as one of our FY21 strategic priorities. We have formaly embraced our sustainability goals and we’ll continue to update you on the progress of the journey. Our priorities for the next couple of quarters include maintaining market-beating growth in large branded and unbranded generic franchises of India, South Africa and the consumer wellness franchise, expanding our lung leadership footprint globally and maximizing value opportunity in the U.S. complex generics, prioritizing key U.S. launches with focused execution, scaling our businesses across branded and generic direct-to-market businesses of Europe and emerging markets through execution, organic and partnered launches, accelerating our digital transformation, capitalize opportunities across markets, focusing on regulatory compliance across manufacturing locations and embracing best-in-class globally-benchmarked ESG practices, and sustained expansion in RoIC over the long term. I know this has been a long day for most of you and I would like to thank you for your attention. And I’ll request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

The most important is what we are trying to do now in terms of consumerizing some of the stronger brands in the Trade Generics business, which have actually have very high customer recall. And the potential to add value through consumerization is quite enormous through the Cipla Health, the Consumer Health business. So, I would say, in terms of stickiness to revenues, in terms of pricing, in terms of margin expansion, and in terms of establishing a strong consumer brand, that’s the value accretion. Some of that could be in P&L, some of that could be in the valuation in terms of the long-term value of a consumer brand. So I wouldn’t put any percentage at this point of time, but this is some out of the recently articulated goals, if you have noticed in one of the conferences recently, I think this is one of our biggest objectives; to take the global consumer business in India and South Africa from the current, let’s say, around 5% to 7% of revenues to beyond 12% of revenue. So I would believe that in cash flows, EBITDA and valuation, I think, this could be a great lever, plus an opportunity to get into the consumer healthcare meaningfully.",

In fact, we think, because of some normalcy returning, because of the stickiness of maybe some of the digital initiatives we planned have not been, probably not stick, I think, it won’t be uncommon to see the EBITDA probably creep down lower a bit.

I think the Trade Generics to CHL consumer undertaking transfer is, we have referred to it. So this, sort of, cements what we have been doing and the subsidiarization of the assets in India which are focused on the U.S. business, that also I think in terms of bringing efficiencies, bringing a structure, which is more efficient that enables us to operate with lot of focus.

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen. Good evening to all of you. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and well. We appreciate you joining us today for the Q4 earnings call for financial year 2021. I hope you have received “Investor Presentation” that we have posted on our website. Cipla continues to be at the forefront in the global fight against the pandemic. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to healthcare and other frontline workers, doctors, nurses, compounders as well as our employees who have been working tirelessly to serve the patients across the country and globe. In this testing time, the pharma industry with the strong support from the central and state governments, have been working to ensure continuous supply of lifesaving medicines. While the uncertainty, the challenges related to the pandemic are evolving, we stay committed to service demand across our markets, monitoring critical filings, continued portfolio expansion along with the resilience in our manufacturing, supply chain and distribution. Our business and cost re-imagination initiatives, supply consistency and rigor on the operational excellence have helped us drive the healthy performance for the quarter and the full year. May 14, 2021 Our profitability improvement journey has sustained across all the quarters during the year and you may have noticed that in the Q4 also, we saw 240 basis points year-on-year expansion in the EBITDA margins. This is despite the fact that Q4 is seasonally a weak quarter and COVID- 19 cases continued to decline sequentially for most part of the quarter. We have also moved a historical trend line from 16% to 19% of EBITDA to over 22% this year and I believe this is quite structural, sustained and will improve from hereon. Our free cash flow generation and operating efficiency helped us become a net cash company and we improved our pre-tax return on invested capital metric by over 750 basis points. We are noticing strong tailwinds across our India portfolio which is likely to play out in Q1 and onwards, this includes a surge in demand for COVID drugs, including Remdesivir and expected pickup in the antibody cocktail among others once we launch. We are also noticing strong demand trigger for our core respiratory product including Budesonide which is now a part of the ICMR protocol. This is quite an interesting trend as compared to what we saw in fiscal 21 and should help drive core portfolio growth in FY22. For the quarter, overall income from operations stands at Rs.4,606 crores, recorded a year-on- year growth of 5% driven by focused execution that I referred earlier. Full year revenue growth is 12%. For the quarter, our One India business which includes Prescription, Trade Generics and Consumer Health portfolios performed in line with our expectations. Our US Generics core formulations sales are at $138 million. Gross margin after material cost stood at about 60%, this is across by 200 basis points impact due to charge on the material cost, that pertains to some of the inventories of products which we build during this COVID period, but couldnt liquidate, it also includes certain overhead charge-off and the one-time shelf stock adjustment for Albuterol. Total expenses which include employee cost and other expenses stood at Rs.1,988 crores, increased by 2% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for the quarter stood at Rs.815 crores and it declined by 4% over the sequential quarter. Other expenses which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion are at Rs.1,123 crores, increased by 7% sequentially. Total R&D investment is about Rs.277 crores. As a percentage of revenue, the spends will moderate in line with the expected surge in revenue, but absolute trajectory of the spends and the filings, it remains intact with assets progressing in the trials and other portfolio development efforts continuing. Reported EBITDA was at Rs.796 crores or 17.3% of sales. Tax charge for the quarter is Rs.128 crores and ETR is lower at 24% or so, the full year ETR was 27%, profit after tax is at Rs.413 crores or 9% of sales. May 14, 2021 As of 31st March 2021, our long-term debt stands at USD138 million towards the InvaGen acquisition and ZAR720 million for the operational requirements at Cipla Medpro in South Africa. We also have working capital loans of $49 million and ZAR75 million which acts as natural hedges towards our receivables. Driven by relentless focus on the cash generation and rigor on cost discipline during the quarter and the year, we continue to be a net cash-positive company as on March end. Outstanding derivatives and the hedge for receivables as of March 21 are $175 million and ZAR684 million apart from additional loans in the Australian dollar and GBP. We have also faced a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues and outstanding cash flow hedges as of 31st March are US$252 million and ZAR654 million. The growth we saw strong execution across our key priorities in FY21 and that included continued growth across our markets, structural expansion in our EBITDA trajectory by over 350 basis points to over 22% and expansion in our pre-tax return on invested capital by more than 750 basis points. I would now like to request “Umang to present the Business and Operational Performance.” Thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. Firstly, I would like to wish all of you and your families to continue to stay safe and well. At Cipla, we continue to support the nation in its fight against the pandemic with our portfolio of COVID products. We salute the grit and sacrifice of healthcare heroes as well as our employees who have been tirelessly working to ensure continuous service to our patients. Our topmost priority in supporting the government’s efforts on increasing availability of the COVID and other life-saving products through strategic inventory build-up and ensuring continuity of operations at our plants. We have enhanced safety protocols across our network to ensure safe operating environment for our colleagues including 24x7 ambulance, consultation and quarantine facilities. Our teams have been working relentlessly to ensure supply continuity of Remdesivir monthly supplies now approaching almost 5x of what we have done during the previous peak of the pandemic. We have also expanded our COVID portfolio with new novel formulations and partnership with MSD for Molnupiravir, Roche for the anti-body cocktail and El Lilly for Baricitinib. We are proud to bring these products to the country and are working on the logistics to ensure availability in the coming weeks and months. With that, let me come to the “Strategic Updates on the Operational Performance.” I am pleased to see the sustained expansion in our EBITDA margins through this year, including in Q4, now trending at over 22% and I believe this trajectory will improve and grow henceforth. May 14, 2021 In India, “One India Strategy” continues to see seamless execution with One India business growing 15% for the year and 4% for the quarter. This is I think the seventh or eighth quarters that we are beating market growth. The prescription business grew 14% for the full year. As per IQVIA MAT March 21 we continue to deliver market-beating growth in our respiratory where we grew 4%, versus the market decline of 8%, Urology, we do 7% versus the market at 4%, Derma at 8% versus the rest of the market at 6%. Cipla consistently ranked #2 with the market share of 8.1% in chronic therapies and grew by 12% versus market growth of 8% from MAT March 21. We are observing strong demand across the COVID portfolio which will reflect in our Q1 numbers. We expect these products which are used to supply, which are used for the COVID effort, will see strong traction in the coming months. Apart from the COVID portfolio, we are also noticing strong volume trend across our acute and respiratory portfolio including Budesonide. Our teams are working to ensure serviceability across these categories. Our Trade Generics business continue to do well with the full year growth of 18% adjusted for transfers to the consumer business. We are seeing demand tailwinds emerging in this part of the business as well. Our Consumer Health business has now scaled up to over Rs.360 crores in revenue, led by a growth in organic anchor brands as well as the continued traction in the transferred consumer brands. In line with the “One India Strategy”, Cipladine brand was transferred to CHL from the Trade Generics business during the quarter. This makes the total number of brands transferred in the last year to 3 and 6 till date. Our participation in the industry’s digital initiatives through the investment in ABCD Technologies and subsequently by ABCD in Pharmarack will also add to the digital channel transformation in India. In the US Generics & lung leadership space, the US Generics core formulation sales for the quarter was US$138 million and factors the one-time shelf stock adjustment for Albuterol based on the competitor entry. Our full year revenue stands at US$551 million. Reflecting on FY21, I am pleased to see the unlocking of our respiratory portfolio with launch and ramp up of Albuterol which is ranked #1 with the TRx market share of 87% of the Proventil market, 16.5% in the generic market, and 13.2% in the overall market as per IQVIA week ending 23rd April 21. Our focus continues on our complex launch engine along with driving growth in the institutional channel. I am pleased to report that for the full year the overall profitability in the US Generics business is very close to company level profitability. May 14, 2021 Our Advair files under active review with FDA. We are working on responding to the queries and we will continue to share the updates. In line with our strategy for the US markets, the non-respiratory portfolio during the year also includes two filed partnered peptide injectables; one of which is an NDA application. Coming to our South Africa and Global Access business which includes South Africa, Sub- Saharan Africa and our Cipla Global Access; the South African private business reported a strong 13% growth over last year for the quarter in local currency. We continue to maintain a third position with the market share of 7% in OTC segment as well as the overall market as per IQVIA MAT March 21. In markets outside South Africa, rest of Saharan business grew by 10% in dollar terms and the decline in the CGA business performance was in line with expectations as higher orders were serviced in the last quarter. In emerging markets, happy to see the business scaling up to US$250 million, growing almost 21% during this year and 4% for the quarter driven by healthy demand across all regions. During the quarter, we also expanded a partnership for four biosimilars in a strategic market of Australia, across immunology, osteoporosis, oncology and ophthalmology. The European business grew 17% on a full year basis and 7% for the quarter, driven by strong in-market performance in key DTMs and market share expansion in our flagship respiratory portfolio. Turning now to our outlook, we have established a new threshold for our operating profitability in FY21 with margins trending over 22% now. Our focus and efforts will be to continue to sustain this in the coming period. On the business side, we see commercial tailwinds across our business which we believe is significantly higher than some of the grids in certain parts. We continue to stay energized with these opportunities and are working to ensure we will be able to service patient demand across our markets. Our long-term priorities remain intact including leveraging the emerging opportunities across our markets and maintaining market-beating growth in branding and branding generic franchises of India, South Africa and also augmenting consumer wellness franchise in both these markets; ramping up the COVID portfolio supply to increase availability and maximize patient reach; continue high vigil on cost and cash management amid the uncertain trajectory of the pandemic; expanding lung leadership globally and by maximizing the value opportunities in US complex generics space; focus on regulatory compliance across manufacturing locations and embracing best-in-class growing benchmarked ESG practices; accelerating our digital transformation to May 14, 2021 capitalize opportunities and growth opportunities across continents and also building a sustainable talent pipeline for the companys future plan over the next three to five years. I would like to thank you for your attention. I will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

      "content": "Saion, I will take the first question. The total COVID medicine sales for the full year at a company level is around 4% or so, it is still less than 5% on full year basis. In Q4, it is less than 3% or so. So I think you should work with some of those numbers. The split of prescription, generics and CHL, we do not want to go into too much details, but generics continues to be less than 20% of the overall One India revenue that we have declared, the total One India is around Rs.7,700 crores and the Trade Generics is less than 20% of that, but it gets little tricky because as you know we have launched an active program to transition consumer brands to the CHL business. I think the best way to look at the whole thing in totality going forward because the base would be different, Saion. But you can roughly work with those numbers. Overall COVID medicines for the full year is between 4% and 5% at company level, split largely to India but some into EM and South Africa and other geographies as well and the split on Trade Generics is less than 20% of total One India. To your last question, its actually the cocktail deal has been signed and as you know we have announced it, we feel quite good about it, I think the reports are pretty strong and its a great weapon in the fight against pandemic. All these details, Saion, we would be more comfortable to announce once the actual launch happens… the launch by the way is not far away from today, but I think with respect to capacity, number of orders, pricing, all that we will be comfortable to share once the launch happens.",

We also said in the last call that we are pretty energized and excited with respect to the levers that we have been able to unleash during this period through multiple ways; one is obviously virtual mode of engaging with channel partners, customers and healthcare practitioners; secondly, introduction of digital wave to run our own business; and thirdly relooking at what is actually discretionary spend and what is the cost of doing business. So, I think our discovery of how efficient our model can be for our domestic business has unleashed a lot of potential, our attempt is to preserve it in the next year and the expectation is not at all to plough back all the costs that we saved in fiscal 21. And thats the comment that I made that vis-à-vis our historical trajectory of EBITDA to 16%-19% or so, we have been able to go to 22.5% or something and idea is to sustain and the structural levers have been unlocked. And a large part of this improvement especially on the cost side and sales and distribution side has got to do with the India business the way it works and engages.

Even if there is an escalation which happens, as I said, we will link it to the activity and we will link it to the sales base of fiscal 22. So any incremental marginal plough back that we have to do from the saving that we did in fiscal 21, we are not worried about that. But I think there are several levers available; pricing is one, mix is another and the portfolio, the launch momentum as well. So I think between these three, four across businesses, we have a plan, Neha, which suggests that the sustainable trajectory of the EBITDA is the range in which we are reporting now.",

I certainly agree gross margin is more we should track but EBITDA is more representative when you the businesses which do not have organic source of the material, but we buy it from outside because the material cost subsumes overheads of our vendors. I think EBITDA is a little more representative. So, I think mix of a particular quarter and typically Q4, Neha, you have seen the trend over the years that by virtue of change in mix and the gross margin get subdued to some extent.

Thats what we have experienced and on the whole while we have seen an escalation we have been able to handle it well from the EBITDA standpoint. So thats how I would answer. Our big priority actually is to secure the quantity of material that we need and we have been able to manage both the quantity and the cost of procurement. To your second question actually the COVID products cannot have a price increase, as you know, all the seven manufacturers of Remdesivir took a price decrease in line with the affordability and access goals in India.

So either you eliminate the activity if it is not value adding or you digitize, make it virtual, I think we are encouraged with this work that we have been doing throughout the company.

So, its not going to go away in months or so if that was your question, but it would be tough for us to tell you precisely, but as I said, at a company level in revenues and profits not that its a huge contributor but whatever it is, it will sustain to a great extent in the near-term and overtime obviously it will be taper down as the cases go down and all of us want that to happen.",

      "content": "Thank you Naveen. A very good evening to all of you. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and well. We appreciate you are joining us today for Q1 earnings call for FY2022. I hope you have received the investor presentation that we have posted on our website. Before I come to the quarter, I hope you have had the time to review our recently published integrated annual report for fiscal 2021. This is our fourth integrated annual report and reflects our relentless focus on improving transparency, governance and setting best-in-class disclosure practices. In this edition we will also give significant updates on our business re-imagination, sustainability, and digital transformation journey. Over the last 15 months Cipla has entered into multiple strategic global collaborations to support the healthcare ecosystem in the fight against the pandemic and living up to a purpose of caring for life. We continue to stay committed to servicing demand across global markets, monitoring the critical filings, continued portfolio expansions, rigor on cost control, digital CIPLA Limited August 05, 2021 engagements along with seamless coordination in our manufacturing, supply chain and distribution. Coming to this quarter we pleased to report another quarter of robust performance with historically the highest reported quarterly revenues with 27% year-on-year growth. As we communicated earlier, we have made a conscious effort to sustain a good share of the operating efficiency in the expense line, which has also helped to deliver sustained EBITDA margin of 24.5% for the quarter. We expect this efficiency is to continue in the coming period as well. The revenue growth for the quarter was driven by sustained momentum in our branded markets of India and South Africa as well as US and API. As alluded in our prior quarterly interactions we did experience significant traction in our One India business led by the strong core portfolio tailwinds in the Prescription and Trade Generics business along with the support from the COVID portfolio during the second COVID wave in India. Excluding COVID, the portfolio momentum continues to be on track with solid double-digit growth during the quarter. You would have noticed the elevated inventory levels which have been a conscious decision on our part to ensure the continuity of supply of our medicines; this also includes a portion towards antibody cocktail inventory that we launched in May. We continue to see strong traction in our US revenue run rate both on a sequential and YoY basis led by further expansion in the Albuterol share and continued respiratory unlocking with the addition of Arformoterol in our portfolio. This has helped us offset the erosion seen in the rest of the portfolio. Our profitability for the quarter continues to track well above our full year targets. For the quarter there is no significant increase in opex on a sequential basis, the Y-o-Y increase is in-line with core revenue growth. We believe that there is reasonable headroom to drive EBITDA on a full year basis versus fiscal 2021. Our free cash generation and operating efficiency continues to drive over net cash position and pre-tax return on invested capital ratio, this metric is now at almost 22.1% on a trailing 12 months basis. Coming to the financial performance for the quarter, we would like to highlight certain specific items, which are subsumed in the reported numbers. At a company level the contribution of COVID is in the high single digit for the quarter and after adjusting for this the revenue growth maintains a strong trajectory of high teens for the company and respective businesses. There is a low base baked in this numbers we are happy to see well diversified growth in the therapy divisions. Our reported API numbers include a profit share on the commercial supply of an API to a partner. Our emerging market business was slightly impacted by timing deferral pertaining to in-country currency allocation for our CIPLA Limited August 05, 2021 Middle Eastern supplies during the quarter. We are highly optimistic that the issue is getting resolved and as we are speaking, infact the initial funding release has happened. As you may be aware that South Africa in the early part of this month went through challenges related to civil protest. Our Durban plant operations did not get impacted much other than some marginal damage to equipments and storage items. We had sufficient inventory on hand as per the norm and look forward to starting full scale normal operations of the plants soon and resume supplies of lifesaving medicines. We have been very closely monitoring the progress of our specialty assets and evaluate options to structure this part of our business for a sustainable future. As you are aware that Avenue received the second Complete Response Letter on IV Tramadol and subsequently concluded a Type A meeting over June-July 2021. In light of this developments and good accounting practice standpoint we have taken one-time impairment of Rs.125 Crores on our investment in Avenue during the quarter. It is captured as an exceptional item. For the quarter overall income from operations is Rs. 5,504 Crores, gross margin after material cost is at 62.4%, approximately 100 basis points decline on a Y-o-Y basis is attributable to contributions from relatively low margins COVID and COVID ancillary products and lower contribution from international markets as well which will offset partly by one time profit share in API; however, on a sequential basis there is almost 200 basis point expansion driven by the improved mix. Total expenses which include employee costs and our expenses are Rs. 2,090 Crores, increased by 5% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for the quarter is at Rs. 887 Crores and that is the function of the increments as well as COVID linked compassionate relief to employees. Other expenses increased by 2.5% sequentially. Total R&D investment is 264 Crores; as a percentage of revenue spends are lower owing to the scale-up in revenues and the absolute trajectory is intact and the portfolio development efforts continue in full swing through the quarter. The reported EBITDA is Rs. 1,346 Crores or 24.5%, tax charge is Rs. 284 Crores and ETR is 28.5, the higher ETR is a function of the fact that we have taken the charge of the impairment, which does not have the tax shield. Profit after tax is about Rs. 715 Crores. As on June 30, 2021, our long-term debt is USD 138 million towards the US acquisition and South Africa loans over ZAR 720 million for the operational requirements in Cipla, South Africa. We also have working capital loans in dollars and rand which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Driven by the relentless focus on cash generation and rigor on cost discipline we continue to be a net cash positive company. Outstanding derivatives and the hedge for receivables are USD 144 million, ZAR 651 million, AUD20 million, CIPLA Limited August 05, 2021 GBP 7 million and EURO 5 million. We have also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. To close, we saw strong tailwinds across portfolio and geographies for Q1. Growth levers in a subsequent quarters will include; Continued market beating growth across branded and consumer businesses; Robust traction in our respiratory franchise across Albuterol and Arformoterol; Sustaining and driving expansion in the operating profitability and pre-tax ROIC; reinvesting the incremental free cash flow into suitable growth linked opportunities. With that I would now like to invite Umang to present the business and operational performance, thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. I would like to wish all of you and your families good health and well being. Amidst the looming threat of a third COVID-19 wave in India our topmost priority is supporting the government efforts on increasing availability of our COVID and other lifesaving products. Our teams have been working relentlessly to ensure supply continuity for the entire COVID portfolio. We have also conducted large scale COVID vaccination drives for our employees, depot associates and families. We have also initiated a compassionate relief policy to the bereaved families of deceased colleagues to stand by them and support them in these moments of grief. Coming to the strategic updates and operational performance, in FY2021 we laid the foundation of our strategic re-imagination journey led by digital transformation of our value chain including stakeholder engagement, R&D, manufacturing, supply chain and business functions. I am pleased to see the continued delivery reflected in the robust performance of the quarter driven by branded markets of India and South Africa and the continued unlocking of our respiratory franchise in the US. Last year we redefined our earnings trajectory both in terms of absolute and EBITDA margins at over 22%. Our EBITDA margins for this quarter came in at 24.5% in line with our commitments to maintaining this trajectory in the current year as well. Our endeavor will be to closely match the operating profitability in the coming quarters despite significant moderation to the contribution of COVID versus last year. In India, Our One India strategy continues to see seamless execution. The One India business grew 68% year-on-year driven by traction in core therapies along with a contribution from the COVID products during the second wave. Adjusting for the core COVID portfolio the revenue growth was still 47% over Q1 of last year. While the impact of COVID-19 will continue to play out in line with the spread of infections and the results of the vaccination drive, we continue to witness strong volumes across core therapies, which is likely to sustain over the coming quarters. The prescription business continued the market beating performance during the quarter driven by the strong volume growth in core therapies and support from existing and new introductions in the portfolio. Our acute and respiratory nebulization businesses have also recovered well. As per IQVIA MAT June 2021 we continue to deliver market beating growth against the IPM, CIPLA Limited August 05, 2021 we grew at 20% versus the 14% growth of the IPM. On the therapy side, the MAT growth versus broader market for respiratory is 14% versus 4%, anti-infective is 10% versus 9%, antidiabetic is 11% versus 9%, derma is 13% versus 12% and cardiac is 10% versus 15%, gastro is 13% versus the 17% and urology is slightly degrowing versus the market. Cipla consistently ranked number two with a market share of 8.2% in chronic therapies and grew by 16% versus the market growth of 12% as per the IQVIA MAT June 2021. We intend to maintain the market beating momentum in the coming quarter and ensure serviceability across our portfolio. The generics business delivered a strong growth adjusted for product transfers to CHL and witnessed healthy quarter flow across regions benefiting from strong demand tailwinds across the core portfolio and the other products that were linked with COVID sales. Consumer health business reported healthy revenue for the quarter led by growth in organic anchor brands as well as continued traction in all of the six consumer brands transferred in FY2021 from the generics business. Coming to North America business, we are happy to report that we have entered the top 10 generic companies in the US by prescriptions driven by the respiratory franchise as well as the strong limited competition launches over the last two to three years. Our portfolio efforts on selection and execution have limited the impact of price erosion on our portfolio and we hope to continue this momentum and scale up as new launches come in. The US generic core formulation sales for the quarter were USD 141 million with a growth of 5% over a high Q1 FY2021 base which included Albuterol. It is also in line with a sequential ramp up despite incremental competition in select product categories. The Albuterol share is also ramped up and today Kedar has already covered the market share that we have in the external reported numbers. I am also delighted to see the continued unlocking of the portfolio with the launch of Arformoterol during the quarter. Our contracted shares for Arformoterol look extremely well and we are working with the channel towards achieving our fair share by maintaining adequate supplies. Our focus on 2022 will continue to deliver complex launches along with driving growth in the institutional channel, which will accelerate in FY2023, which we expect to be a big year of launches. On Advair we are working with FDA and responding to the queries and will continue to share the updates on the progress of the file. We continue to work with FDA on the observations in the Goa plant. We have equipped the plant with required infrastructure to facilitate any virtual audit in case the agency requires one. Coming to SAGA, which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and CGA, the overall region reported a robust revenue growth of 13% in USD terms, and South Africa private business reported a 7% growth over last year for the quarter. In secondary terms we continue to maintain market beating growth of 7.6% versus 5.1% as per IQVIA MAT June 2021. We continue to maintain the third position with a market share of 6.6% in the OTC CIPLA Limited August 05, 2021 and 7.1% in the overall private market. The Sub-Saharan business also witnessed strong demand in markets impacted by COVID-19 as compared to the previous year. Coming to international markets which include emerging market and Europe business; the emerging market business was impacted by issues of timing deferral that Kedar mentioned in his commentary. We are optimistic that this issue will get resolved and subsequent billing shall happen in this quarter. The API business reported a growth of 69% in US dollar terms and includes a profit share of the commercial supplies of an API to a partner. Turning now to our outlook, we look forward to building this strong start to FY2022. The underlying momentum of our growth drivers for the portfolio continues to be robust across markets. We will allocate capital to enriching our capabilities across portfolio and digital technology platforms to enable the patientcare continuum. Our near-term priorities include a continued execution on the demand levers in the chronic and acute therapies, improving the manpower productivity across branded and generic markets of India and South Africa. Active advancement and innovative consumer centric products to accelerate the augmentation of a global consumer wellness franchise across India and South Africa continue to lead the respiratory categories such as for Albuterol and for Arformoterol and strengthen and accelerate lung leadership aspirations. Maximizing the value opportunity in the US complex generics space with launch momentum and with facilities always in compliance and control and continued vigil on cost and cash management, operating margins and return on capital employed. I would like to thank you for your attention, and we will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

The opex includes a portion which is linked to sell so there are commissions and other discount and some of the data, etc., which are linked to sales so I think to the extent sales move up or down I think back portion of the office would change and R&D is especially based upon the progress of respect to molecules I think that is how the P&L would get shaped up, but I think like to clarify that our attempt is to despite not having as much as COVID as last year out attempt is to meet or exceed what we reported for the last year.",

As we communicated earlier, we have made a conscious effort to sustain a good share of the operating efficiency in the expense line, which has also helped to deliver sustained EBITDA margin of 24.5% for the quarter. We expect this efficiency is to continue in the coming period as well. The revenue growth for the quarter was driven by sustained momentum in our branded markets of India and South Africa as well as US and API. As alluded in our prior quarterly interactions we did experience significant traction in our One India business led by the strong core portfolio tailwinds in the Prescription and Trade Generics business along with the support from the COVID portfolio during the second COVID wave in India. Excluding COVID, the portfolio momentum continues to be on track with solid double-digit growth during the quarter. You would have noticed the elevated inventory levels which have been a conscious decision on our part to ensure the continuity of supply of our medicines; this also includes a portion towards antibody cocktail inventory that we launched in May. We continue to see strong traction in our US revenue run rate both on a sequential and YoY basis led by further expansion in the Albuterol share and continued respiratory unlocking with the addition of Arformoterol in our portfolio. This has helped us offset the erosion seen in the rest of the portfolio. Our profitability for the quarter continues to track well above our full year targets. For the quarter there is no significant increase in opex on a sequential basis, the Y-o-Y increase is in-line with core revenue growth. We believe that there is reasonable headroom to drive EBITDA on a full year basis versus fiscal 2021. Our free cash generation and operating efficiency continues to drive over net cash position and pre-tax return on invested capital ratio, this metric is now at almost 22.1% on a trailing 12 months basis. Coming to the financial performance for the quarter, we would like to highlight certain specific items, which are subsumed in the reported numbers. At a company level the contribution of COVID is in the high single digit for the quarter and after adjusting for this the revenue growth maintains a strong trajectory of high teens for the company and respective businesses. There is a low base baked in this numbers we are happy to see well diversified growth in the therapy divisions. Our reported API numbers include a profit share on the commercial supply of an API to a partner. Our emerging market business was slightly impacted by timing deferral pertaining to in-country currency allocation for our CIPLA Limited August 05, 2021 Middle Eastern supplies during the quarter. We are highly optimistic that the issue is getting resolved and as we are speaking, infact the initial funding release has happened. As you may be aware that South Africa in the early part of this month went through challenges related to civil protest. Our Durban plant operations did not get impacted much other than some marginal damage to equipments and storage items. We had sufficient inventory on hand as per the norm and look forward to starting full scale normal operations of the plants soon and resume supplies of lifesaving medicines. We have been very closely monitoring the progress of our specialty assets and evaluate options to structure this part of our business for a sustainable future. As you are aware that Avenue received the second Complete Response Letter on IV Tramadol and subsequently concluded a Type A meeting over June-July 2021. In light of this developments and good accounting practice standpoint we have taken one-time impairment of Rs.125 Crores on our investment in Avenue during the quarter. It is captured as an exceptional item. For the quarter overall income from operations is Rs. 5,504 Crores, gross margin after material cost is at 62.4%, approximately 100 basis points decline on a Y-o-Y basis is attributable to contributions from relatively low margins COVID and COVID ancillary products and lower contribution from international markets as well which will offset partly by one time profit share in API; however, on a sequential basis there is almost 200 basis point expansion driven by the improved mix. Total expenses which include employee costs and our expenses are Rs. 2,090 Crores, increased by 5% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for the quarter is at Rs. 887 Crores and that is the function of the increments as well as COVID linked compassionate relief to employees. Other expenses increased by 2.5% sequentially. Total R&D investment is 264 Crores; as a percentage of revenue spends are lower owing to the scale-up in revenues and the absolute trajectory is intact and the portfolio development efforts continue in full swing through the quarter. The reported EBITDA is Rs. 1,346 Crores or 24.5%, tax charge is Rs. 284 Crores and ETR is 28.5, the higher ETR is a function of the fact that we have taken the charge of the impairment, which does not have the tax shield. Profit after tax is about Rs. 715 Crores. As on June 30, 2021, our long-term debt is USD 138 million towards the US acquisition and South Africa loans over ZAR 720 million for the operational requirements in Cipla, South Africa. We also have working capital loans in dollars and rand which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Driven by the relentless focus on cash generation and rigor on cost discipline we continue to be a net cash positive company. Outstanding derivatives and the hedge for receivables are USD 144 million, ZAR 651 million, AUD20 million, CIPLA Limited August 05, 2021 GBP 7 million and EURO 5 million. We have also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. To close, we saw strong tailwinds across portfolio and geographies for Q1. Growth levers in a subsequent quarters will include; Continued market beating growth across branded and consumer businesses; Robust traction in our respiratory franchise across Albuterol and Arformoterol; Sustaining and driving expansion in the operating profitability and pre-tax ROIC; reinvesting the incremental free cash flow into suitable growth linked opportunities. With that I would now like to invite Umang to present the business and operational performance, thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. I would like to wish all of you and your families good health and well being. Amidst the looming threat of a third COVID-19 wave in India our topmost priority is supporting the government efforts on increasing availability of our COVID and other lifesaving products. Our teams have been working relentlessly to ensure supply continuity for the entire COVID portfolio. We have also conducted large scale COVID vaccination drives for our employees, depot associates and families. We have also initiated a compassionate relief policy to the bereaved families of deceased colleagues to stand by them and support them in these moments of grief. Coming to the strategic updates and operational performance, in FY2021 we laid the foundation of our strategic re-imagination journey led by digital transformation of our value chain including stakeholder engagement, R&D, manufacturing, supply chain and business functions. I am pleased to see the continued delivery reflected in the robust performance of the quarter driven by branded markets of India and South Africa and the continued unlocking of our respiratory franchise in the US. Last year we redefined our earnings trajectory both in terms of absolute and EBITDA margins at over 22%. Our EBITDA margins for this quarter came in at 24.5% in line with our commitments to maintaining this trajectory in the current year as well. Our endeavor will be to closely match the operating profitability in the coming quarters despite significant moderation to the contribution of COVID versus last year. In India, Our One India strategy continues to see seamless execution. The One India business grew 68% year-on-year driven by traction in core therapies along with a contribution from the COVID products during the second wave. Adjusting for the core COVID portfolio the revenue growth was still 47% over Q1 of last year. While the impact of COVID-19 will continue to play out in line with the spread of infections and the results of the vaccination drive, we continue to witness strong volumes across core therapies, which is likely to sustain over the coming quarters. The prescription business continued the market beating performance during the quarter driven by the strong volume growth in core therapies and support from existing and new introductions in the portfolio. Our acute and respiratory nebulization businesses have also recovered well. As per IQVIA MAT June 2021 we continue to deliver market beating growth against the IPM, CIPLA Limited August 05, 2021 we grew at 20% versus the 14% growth of the IPM. On the therapy side, the MAT growth versus broader market for respiratory is 14% versus 4%, anti-infective is 10% versus 9%, antidiabetic is 11% versus 9%, derma is 13% versus 12% and cardiac is 10% versus 15%, gastro is 13% versus the 17% and urology is slightly degrowing versus the market. Cipla consistently ranked number two with a market share of 8.2% in chronic therapies and grew by 16% versus the market growth of 12% as per the IQVIA MAT June 2021. We intend to maintain the market beating momentum in the coming quarter and ensure serviceability across our portfolio. The generics business delivered a strong growth adjusted for product transfers to CHL and witnessed healthy quarter flow across regions benefiting from strong demand tailwinds across the core portfolio and the other products that were linked with COVID sales. Consumer health business reported healthy revenue for the quarter led by growth in organic anchor brands as well as continued traction in all of the six consumer brands transferred in FY2021 from the generics business. Coming to North America business, we are happy to report that we have entered the top 10 generic companies in the US by prescriptions driven by the respiratory franchise as well as the strong limited competition launches over the last two to three years. Our portfolio efforts on selection and execution have limited the impact of price erosion on our portfolio and we hope to continue this momentum and scale up as new launches come in. The US generic core formulation sales for the quarter were USD 141 million with a growth of 5% over a high Q1 FY2021 base which included Albuterol. It is also in line with a sequential ramp up despite incremental competition in select product categories. The Albuterol share is also ramped up and today Kedar has already covered the market share that we have in the external reported numbers. I am also delighted to see the continued unlocking of the portfolio with the launch of Arformoterol during the quarter. Our contracted shares for Arformoterol look extremely well and we are working with the channel towards achieving our fair share by maintaining adequate supplies. Our focus on 2022 will continue to deliver complex launches along with driving growth in the institutional channel, which will accelerate in FY2023, which we expect to be a big year of launches. On Advair we are working with FDA and responding to the queries and will continue to share the updates on the progress of the file. We continue to work with FDA on the observations in the Goa plant. We have equipped the plant with required infrastructure to facilitate any virtual audit in case the agency requires one. Coming to SAGA, which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and CGA, the overall region reported a robust revenue growth of 13% in USD terms, and South Africa private business reported a 7% growth over last year for the quarter. In secondary terms we continue to maintain market beating growth of 7.6% versus 5.1% as per IQVIA MAT June 2021. We continue to maintain the third position with a market share of 6.6% in the OTC CIPLA Limited August 05, 2021 and 7.1% in the overall private market. The Sub-Saharan business also witnessed strong demand in markets impacted by COVID-19 as compared to the previous year. Coming to international markets which include emerging market and Europe business; the emerging market business was impacted by issues of timing deferral that Kedar mentioned in his commentary. We are optimistic that this issue will get resolved and subsequent billing shall happen in this quarter. The API business reported a growth of 69% in US dollar terms and includes a profit share of the commercial supplies of an API to a partner. Turning now to our outlook, we look forward to building this strong start to FY2022. The underlying momentum of our growth drivers for the portfolio continues to be robust across markets. We will allocate capital to enriching our capabilities across portfolio and digital technology platforms to enable the patientcare continuum. Our near-term priorities include a continued execution on the demand levers in the chronic and acute therapies, improving the manpower productivity across branded and generic markets of India and South Africa. Active advancement and innovative consumer centric products to accelerate the augmentation of a global consumer wellness franchise across India and South Africa continue to lead the respiratory categories such as for Albuterol and for Arformoterol and strengthen and accelerate lung leadership aspirations. Maximizing the value opportunity in the US complex generics space with launch momentum and with facilities always in compliance and control and continued vigil on cost and cash management, operating margins and return on capital employed. I would like to thank you for your attention, and we will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

The opex includes a portion which is linked to sell so there are commissions and other discount and some of the data, etc., which are linked to sales so I think to the extent sales move up or down I think back portion of the office would change and R&D is especially based upon the progress of respect to molecules I think that is how the P&L would get shaped up, but I think like to clarify that our attempt is to despite not having as much as COVID as last year out attempt is to meet or exceed what we reported for the last year.",

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen. Good evening to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today for the second quarter earnings call for the financial year 22. Before I begin, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and well. These are also festive times ahead. And I have always believed that pharma is amazingly complex sector, and you all keep doing amazingly good work. A lot of hard work during the course of the year. I am always impressed by your commentary and your direct and indirect push to management teams to improve the performance. So, I wish that you know you get to spend decent time with your family during this festival days ahead. Coming to the quarter, we are pleased to report historically the highest quarterly revenue with a 10% YOY growth. Our continued trigger on cost and operating efficiency while continuing our focus on growth linked investments have helped us deliver robust EBITDA margin ahead of 22% for the quarter. We expect these efficiencies to continue in the coming period as well. Cipla Limited October 26, 2021 The 10% growth was driven by sustained momentum in branded markets of India and South Africa, and emerging markets. On a high base of FY21 last year, the growth in one India is impressive and lead by sustained traction across core therapies both in prescription and trade generics business, despite significant moderation in the COVID contribution. EBITDA percentage of 22% ahead is in line with our guidance and includes inventory provision deemed appropriate for the COVID inventory that we are carrying. Our working capital levels reflect our commitment to ensure the continued serviceability of supply given several headwinds in the sourcing environment. Our US revenues continue to see desired traction led by Albuterol and now with Arformoterol in Quarter 2. We have also witnessed steady momentum in the select products, which positions the portfolio to better respond to price erosion seen in the rest of the portfolio. And our free cash generation and operating efficiencies continue to drive our strong net cash position. Coming to the financial performance, we wanted to highlight certain specifics. At a company level the contribution of COVID was little more than 5% for this quarter, adjusted for the same revenue growth of the company is at a strong trajectory of more than 10% on a like-to- like base of last year. As alluded in Q1 call, while our emerging market business is recovered during the quarter, select products in our European operations have seen some bit of competition. Similarly, tender flows in SAGA was also partly impacted by some delays in the order confirmation from clients. But the quarter overall income from operation stands at Rs. 5,520 crores. Gross margin after material cost stood at 61.3 for the quarter, while the gross margin was in line on a year-on-year basis, the sequential decline of 100 basis points is attributable to change in mix on account of normalization in the COVID portfolio and normalization of the API profit share with some inventory provisions that I referred to early. Total expenses, which include employee costs and other expenses stood at Rs. 2,157 crores, increased by 3% on a sequential basis. Employee costs for the quarter at Rs. 878 crores. It declined by 1% on a sequential basis. The other expenses which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion stood at Rs. 1,279 crores. They increased by 6%, largely driven by sales linked variable expenses that we incur for various geographies. Total R&D investment for the quarter is about Rs. 274 crores, or 5% of revenue. All priority projects continue to be on track, and we expect R&D spends to respond to the clinical trial program going forward. Reported EBITDA was Rs. 1,226 crores or 22.2% of sales. The effective tax rate is 28.5% and we reported profit after tax of Rs. 711 crores, or 12.9% of sales. As of 30th September, our long-term debt stands at R720 million. These are for operating requirements at South Africa. During the quarter we have prepaid the outstanding $137.5 million Cipla Limited October 26, 2021 in InvaGen acquisition debt. With that we have completely repaid all the loan for the US acquisition. We have working capital loans of $74 million, Rand 337 million and Australian Dollar 5 million, which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Driven by our relentless focus on cash generation and rigor on cost discipline, during the quarter we continue to be a net cash positive company. Outstanding derivatives as a hedge for receivables as of 30th September are $155 million, South African Rand 666 million, Australian dollar 17 million, £7 million and €6 million. Further outstanding derivatives are the hedges for payables as of 30th September, are $11 million and €1 million. We have also hedged a certain portion of our forecasted export revenues. The outstanding cash flow hedges as on 30th September are $280 million, Rand 460 million and Australian dollar 9 million. As you are aware we had announced the scheme of demerger for our consumer health business and the India based assets of the US business. We continue to believe that the scheme will simplify the structure, maximize efficiencies, and it has the potential to unlock value for all the stakeholders of the company. We did an extensive assessment, and we understand that certain changes in the regulatory environment have made it feasible for the proposed transfer to be done quite efficiently through an alternate option and without the need for a scheme of arrangement. Accordingly, in the meeting today, the board has approved not to proceed ahead with this scheme and to examine transfer of these businesses by way of a more efficient option. To close, we saw robust momentum across portfolio and geographies for first half. Growth levers in the subsequent quarters will include continued momentum across all regions. Robust traction in our respiratory franchise in the US and continued launches. And thirdly, pivoting businesses to sustain strong execution and driving expansion in the operating profitability. I would now like to invite Umang to present the business and operating performance. Thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. I would like to wish all of you and your families a good health and I hope that everyone is safe and well. We continue to support the government efforts on ensuring availability of our COVID and other life scaling products. We are pleased to see the robust vaccination rates in the country and are happy to report that 89% of our colleagues across our operating geographies have taken at least one dose and 59% have been fully vaccinated. Coming to the strategic updates and operational performance, I am pleased to see continued delivery reflected in the robust performance for the quarter driven by our branded markets of India and South Africa, supported by the unlocking of our respiratory franchise in the US and traction in emerging markets despite geopolitical headwinds. Cipla Limited October 26, 2021 Our EBITDA margins for the quarter came in at 22.2% and continue to reflect our commitment to maintain the trajectory in FY22 despite significant moderation in the contribution of Covid versus the previous year. In India, One India strategy continues to see seamless execution. After delivering over a $1 billion for our One India franchise in fiscal year 21, we are tracking towards delivering $1 billion of revenue for our branded prescription business in India. On a high FY21 base, which included COVID products, the One India business grew 16% year- on-year driven by robust traction in core therapies, despite expected normalization in the contribution from COVID product levels that we witnessed in the earlier waves. The revenue growth of 25% adjusted for core-COVID products over quarter two of the previous year stands at testimony to the strong on-ground engagements with healthcare professionals and the strength of our large brands. We believe and are hopeful that this traction is likely to continue for the rest of the year, as COVID-19 cases respond to the vaccination drive across the country. The branded prescription business continued the strong performance during the quarter driven by sustained volume growth across almost all our therapies. Our acute and respiratory nebulization businesses are also tracking well. As per IQVIA MAT-September 21, we continue to maintain ranks and market shares and our key therapy areas across respiratory, urology, anti- infective and cardiac. Over the last three years, we have forged strong partnerships with several MNC organizations for the strategic widening of our therapy base with specialty offerings across cardiology, anti- diabetic, oncology franchise. With an ambition to increase access to innovative medicines and enhance our chronic portfolio, we have also recently announced a partnership with Eli Lily for the diabetes franchise. This is of course subject to regulatory approvals. The trade generics business and consumer businesses have continued to deliver strong growth across flagship brands in respective businesses for their quarter. Coming to our North America business, the US generics core formulation sales for the quarter were a multi quarter high of $ 142 million in line with our expectations for the sequential run rate. Select products like Diclofenac, Sertraline, Escitalopram and Esomeprazole have witnessed steady momentum, which along with Albuterol has helped in inching up the run rate and offsetting the price erosion in the rest of the portfolio. As per IQVIA week ending 8th October 21, we have clocked an 18% share in Albuterol and Arformoterol which we launched in the current quarter has garnered about 39% share in the generic market. Difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion, which was also launched during the quarter has also tracking well in terms of the desired contracted share. We continue to maintain strong focus on the adequate supply of products and prepare for upcoming complex launches in the subsequent quarters. On Advair we have responded to the Cipla Limited October 26, 2021 CRL to the USFDA, and we will continue to share the updates on progress on the file as we hear more. We have been in continuous communication with the FDA for the Goa plant. We are awaiting the inspection scheduled from the agency. Coming to SAGA, which includes South Africa, Sub Saharan Africa and GGA, the overall SAGA region reported robust growth of 8% on a year-on- year basis in U.S. dollar terms. Our South Africa private business reported 20% growth over last year for the quarter in local currency terms. In secondary terms, we continue to maintain market beating growth of 8.7% versus the 5.4% private market growth as per IQVIA MAT August 21. The Sub-Saharan and CGA tender business as we mentioned earlier, witnessed some delays in order confirmation from the client. Our international markets reported 14% revenue growth year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms. Our emerging markets business rebounded after resuming Middle Eastern supplies, which demonstrated strong performance in our direct to market businesses and from the contribution from COVID therapy products. We have witnessed incrementing competition in Europe for a select category leading to lower than anticipated performance. We expect to offset some of these headwinds with traction and new launches in the subsequent quarters. During the quarter, we launched bevacizumab biosimilar under partnership in Spain to strengthen our oncology portfolio. Turning now to our outlook, we continue to strengthen our revenue streams with a differentiated portfolio. Our product development capabilities and de-risking the supply chain across our markets. We are witnessing emerging demand patterns across our businesses amid gradually recovering COVID environment. We are geared up to capitalize on the opportunities across the healthcare ecosystem to drive a robust portfolio momentum and strategic capital allocation. Our near-term priorities include, the continued execution on the demand levers in the chronic and acute therapies, improvement in manpower, productivity across the branded and generic markets of India and South Africa. Active advancement on innovative consumer centric products to accelerate the augmentation of a Global Consumer Wellness franchise across both India and South Africa. Continue to lead and grow respiratory categories like Albuterol and achieve our fair share in several other products that we are likely to launch. Monitor our key filings and accelerate our global lung leadership aspirations. Maximize the value opportunity in the US complex generics with continued launch momentum and manufacturing facilities in a state of compliance and control. And continue the high vigil on cost and cash management, operating margins and the return on capital employed. Cipla Limited October 26, 2021 With this, I would like to thank you for your attention. I wish you a very happy festival season and for those of us in India Very Happy Diwali. And will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

And because there were hardly any viral infections and other infections going around, when the COVID outbreak was there in the previous year. This year we have seen almost significant reduction in the Covid and, you know, an increase in anti-in factor. I think the winter season typically for Cipla is when the respiratory sales begin to peak, but if your question is whether I can give you a certainty in terms of how each of these will play out? I think they constantly change, every 15 to 20 days we are seeing different market shifts and patterns. I think we are hoping to see a relatively strong respiratory season this time in quarter 3. And I think over a period of time, the India growth will begin to moderate back to its historical average of 10% to 12% in the industry growth. And of course, we will try to be higher than that.",

We appreciate your joining us today for the third quarter earnings call for FY22 and I hope you have received the investor presentation and other material that we have posted on the website. This quarter we are pleased to report a healthy performance. For the last almost 2 years we have been consistently beating our internal targets. We recorded revenue growth of 6% driven by robust momentum in branded markets of India and South Africa and continued traction in the US portfolio. Our EBITDA margin of 22.7% for the quarter tracks convincingly in terms of our full year guidance despite cost headwinds on raw materials and freight offset by increased share of the complex and chronic launches, continue rigor on cost control and operating efficiencies. Overall our delivery on revenue and profitability, as I said continue to be ahead of our targets. Our one India year-on-year growth of 13% continues the impressive run driven by sustained momentum across all businesses. Healthy order flow in the prescription business continued across all the therapies as well as regions in the trade generics. The consumer business saw consistent uptick in core and transitioned brands. The US revenue for the quarter was USD 150 million, one of the highest in recent quarters led by strong fraction in the respiratory and other portfolio. We have also received approval for the first 505(b)(2) version of Lanreotide injection. Our South Africa private business maintains market meeting trajectory driven by steady launch momentum. The YTD EBITDA for 9 months is at 23.1% of sales, tracks quite ahead with our full year guidance. As you are aware Q4 is a seasonally reverse quarter for India and our EBITDA appropriately will respond to the change in mix. Cipla Limited January 25, 2022 Our free cash generation and operating efficiency continues to drive our strong net cash position despite strategic inventory buildup for maintaining adequate supply of medicines. The return on invested capital of 21.2% for trailing 12 months continues to track well above the long-term sustainable range that we have highlighted earlier. Coming to the financial performance, some of the specific highlights I would like to highlight, as expected the revenue of contribution of COVID products at the company level was lower on year-on-year basis. The COVID portfolio declined by almost 10% on year-on-year basis and 17% sequentially. We do expect to see some traction in the coming quarter in line with the case loads amid the ongoing third wave in India. Our emerging market business continues to maintain strong growth in DTM markets. The order flow from developed markets in our API business has witnessed momentary slowdown and our mix has responded accordingly. We will see traction in orders from emerging markets and API Outlook remains robust. The total revenue for the quarter is Rs. 5,479 crores with a year-on-year growth of 6%, gross margin stood at 60.9% on a reported basis. The marginal decline on year-on-year basis of 55 basis points, about 40 basis points on Q-on-Q basis is attributed to increase in freight and materials cost and certain provisions for the inventory including COVID products. We expect gross margins to respond to launches from complex pipeline in the coming quarters. Total expenses which include employee cost on others are at Rs. 2,105 crores declined by 2.4% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for the quarter is Rs. 872 crores which is flat on a sequential basis. Other expenses which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion are at Rs. 1,232 crores, the decline by 3.7% driven by strong cost control. We have retained the efficiencies from our reimagination and operational efficiency initiatives from last year while continuing our growth-linked investments which are driving the Y-o-Y increase in other expenses. Total R&D investment for the quarter is at Rs. 262 crores. All the priority projects continue to be on track. We expect these spends to increase as the respiratory assets progress in the clinical trials. Overall reported EBITDA for the quarter is at Rs. 1,243 crores or 22.7% of sales. Tax charge is Rs. 295 crores and the ETR is 28%. As of 31st December our long term debt stands at South African Rand 720 million. We also have working capital loans of USD 58 million, South African Rand 137 million and Australian dollar 5 million which act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Driven by our relentless focus on cash generation we continue to be a net cash positive company as of December 21. We continue to be appropriately hedged on key global currencies as per our policies. Finally just to conclude the board at its meeting held on 26th October, withdrew the scheme of arrangement for the proposed transfer of India based US business undertaking to Cipla Biotech Ltd. and the proposed transfer of the consumer business undertaking to Cipla Health Ltd. in favor of a more efficient mechanism to affect the transaction. Based on management proposal post the indepth reevaluation, the board has approved the Cipla Limited January 25, 2022 proposed transfer of the US business undertaking and consumer business undertaking by way of slump sale. We continue to believe that the transaction will simplify the structure, maximize the efficiencies and has the potential to unlock value for all the stakeholders of the company. To close, we saw impressive momentum across portfolio and geographies for 9 months, growth reversal in subsequent quarters will include continued momentum across all regions, securing market share in peptide assets, Lanreotide, coupled with traction in albuterol and arformoterol in US and driving expansion in the operating profitability above FY21 base by focusing on mix improvement and operational efficiencies. I would now like to invite Umang to present the business and operational performance. Thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you, Kedar. I would like to wish all of you and your families, health and wellbeing. As COVID-19 continues to evolve across the globe with the new variants driving caseloads we continue to ensure availability of COVID and other lifesaving products. Coming to our strategic updates and operational performance for the quarter, I am proud of the strong launch and commercial momentum across our one India business with a 13% year-on- year growth and 7% year-on-year growth in our US business, underpinned by the expanding respiratory franchise. Our EBITDA margins for the quarter came in at 22.7%, as Kedar mentioned earlier, ahead of our internal target and given the 23.1% YTD traction we are well placed to close the year in line with our guidance. In India our One India strategy is witnessing remarkable traction and achieving major milestones along the journey. The One India business maintains double digit growth momentum for the third quarter this year coming in at 13% year- on-year. The core prescription business in India excluding COVID grew strongly by 16% on a year-on-year basis. The branded prescription business is on track to achieve the one billion dollar mark building a formidable franchise in our home market of India. Our customer engagement levels in our trade generic business has driven healthy orders from tier 2 and below towns in India. Some of our flagship generic brands in our trade generic business have grown past a 100 crores mark and few others are crossing the 50 crores mark which speaks about the brand equity in these markets. We also plan to add high growth categories like anti diabetic and injectables to address unmet demand in the coming quarters. The branded prescription business continued the market beating growth for the third consecutive quarter in FY22 driven by sustained traction across almost all our therapies in core portfolio. As per IQVIA MAT December 21, we continue to maintain healthy ranks and market shares in our key therapy areas across respiratory, urology, anti-infective and cardiac. Our focus continues in creating depth in anti-diabetics and the oncology therapy building on existing and new partnerships with global multinational corporations. The trade generics business witness strong demand. We have launched 10 brands across cardiac and the diabetic range this year. To further strengthen the franchise plan to continue the launch momentum in FY23. Cipla Limited January 25, 2022 Coming to our consumer businesses, we are very happy to see how the business has shaped both in India and South Africa, almost contributing 8% to the company topline on a YTD basis. The India consumer business sustained robust traction in the anchor brands during the quarter driven by high consumer recall benefiting from the robust media campaign, the meaningful consumer insights throughout the year. Coming to North America, our US generic core formulation sales for the quarter came in at 150 million beating the previous quarter high. This 150 million mark sets a new base for our business which hopefully will grow from these levels on the back of our upcoming launches. Our respiratory franchise continues with strong traction with 36% year-on-year growth. As per IQVIA week ending 21st December 2021, we are close to 15.9% share of the total albuterol market. And 26.8% share in the arformoterol overall market and our shares have continued to move out from the earlier levels. We expect the business runrate to continue to inch up further as we enter into the next year where we also expect to show growth over the pace of the current year. During the quarter we have unlocked on major peptide asset in the US with the approval of Lanreotide. We are expecting a sustainable ramp up over the medium term. Our focus will continue to expand our peptide portfolio through internal development and partnerships strengthening our high value complex generic pipeline. On Advair we remain closely engaged with the US FDA on our file and we will continue to share the updates on the progress. On our Goa plant we are awaiting to hear from the FDA on the inspection schedule. Coming to our SAGA Region which includes South Africa, Sub Saharan Africa and our Access business. South Africa private business reported a 16% robust growth over the last year for the quarter in local currency terms. In secondary terms, we continue to maintain market beating growth of 9.1% versus the 8% growth overall in the private market as per IQVIA MAT November 21. In the international markets we maintained scale close to last year base in US dollar terms. Our DTM franchise continue to witness strong momentum across market with steady double digit growth in secondary terms. In FY22 we have made significant progress against our strategic priorities. We remained confident in our near to medium-term outlook due to the strength of our branded franchises and launch pipeline in the US and other markets. We have important launches in the coming quarters and we are gearing up for these launches in the near future. We are transforming our IPD manufacturing supply chain and quality operations to unlock efficiencies targeted to deliver higher performance and resilience serving our patients more effectively. Our innovation engine seeks to capitalize on the opportunities across the healthcare ecosystem leveraging data analytics and digital technologies to drive robust portfolio momentum and capital allocation. Our near-term priorities include continued execution on the demand levers and chronic and acute therapies, improvement in manpower productivity across our branded Cipla Limited January 25, 2022 markets of India and South Africa. Active advancement of our innovative consumer centric products to accelerate the augmentation of consumer wellness franchise across India and South Africa, grow our US Limited Competition launches footprint including peptides, as we continue to expand both the injectables and respiratory categories in North America. Focus on regulatory compliance across our manufacturing facilities and implement globally benchmarked ESG practices and continue our high vigil on cost and cash management while driving a sustainable expansion in operating margins and the return on capital employed. I would like to thank you for your attention. Wish you and your family good health and then request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

And over the last 2-3 years we have been looking at that we have been doing tie ups for onco or for biosimilar and these kind of products to grow the market or presence in these markets, so just want to understand when we talk of the levers for growth, is it like these tieups become a very important lever for us to continue growing or do you think from our own organic pipeline we have product launches which can sustain the growth or how should we understand between these tie ups, organic and probably inorganic acquisition?",

Second would be the riskier assets like where probably the investment could happen, but we don’t know the exact outcomes. The outcome could be 0 or 1.

To that effect, we have created certain, we would like to, we have mentioned that we will grow, our attempt will be to grow both ROIC as well as our EBITDA in a certain range. And though we are now feeling confident that we can that, you know, EBITDA could continue to increase on the back of launch momentum etc., We are also talking calls to invest back in the business because right now we would like to see the growth journey of this business to be sustained over a period of time. If the call is, can you do 25% EBITDA and 5% growth, versus could you do 23.5% or 24% EBITDA and 10% growth. We are likely to fall back on getting more growth over the long term. So we are actively reinvesting back in the business. The second question is, you asked about R&D, we have generally given a guidance range that we will not expect our R&D in years where we have bulky and chunky R&D to be more than 7%-7.5%. So we are very clear about how much money we will invest in R&D and where the focus will be to grow our topline. So these are two broad yardsticks that you could use while our objective is to improve our EBITDA trajectory further. We are going to try and reinvest money back into the business to support growth. From a shareholder perspective this is more the board decide, I think based on where they think depending on where, how we see our capital needs for the future and a benchmark performance of companies that we see in the market and I think based on that it has been probably our first or first one and a half year of cash surplus. Dividend strategy is decided by the board in terms of how to return money back to the shareholder. Cipla Limited January 25, 2022",

Vis-à-vis the next year our thoughts are still being shaped by all these evolving developments. What we are happy is and you could have seen that in our presentation, Prakash, is all the key therapies, respiratory, urology, cardio, overall chronic, acute, I think we are experiencing strong growth. So it would be tough to for us to exclude COVID and talk only on non-COVID because some part of COVID in our view might continue in year as well. So maybe in the May call when we announce full year result that maybe a baseline for us to give some clue into next year. But growth continues strong in Rx business, Gx business and consumer health business. And just to add, I think couple of deals we had announced. So I think maybe you should factor the contribution from some of these deals that we had announced in the past which will get commercialized now, hereafter.",

I think portfolio is one, supply chain and distribution is another. Some of the capabilities for campaigns, advertisements, ATL spends is third.

So I think there are several angles Bharatji in which we could leverage and we are leveraging between these three businesses. There is an active work stream which we have been speaking about for some of the brands which are in generics business, which have very high recall and those are actually consumer brands and those are being contributed heavily by CHL business either through their own channel, model trade and in terms of approaching consumers, converting it to an almost like a B2C kind of brands. So some of this is already in the numbers, Bharatji and we believe that going forward there is very strong synergy across all these angles. We are particularly excited and interested on two counts. One is the consumerization, as I mentioned secondly the digital aspect. So digital analytic reaching healthcare practitioners, reaching channel partners, analyzing brick-by-brick throughout the Indian demography and targeting specifically for particular region, particular therapy. I think those are the avenues in which we are seeing an enormous power for all our three businesses. And obviously as I said I think the performance is in the current numbers as well and are hopeful that it will shape up to become a more dominant engine in the coming year.",

So the two products at some points overlap an interface for a few indications in the market and I think that is the issue why we are seeing that Lanreotide growth has been high and of course there has also been value growth that every year it does take on their portfolio, so it is a little difficult to estimate what are two new starts because of this mix. But we have an historical average and of the total patient pool I dont think the number of new starts is very significant from a Lanreotide perspective, but it is right now the data is convoluted because of some amount of interfaces with octreotide.",

Second question is, that is more general question. Once the product is transferred from Gx to let us say consumer portfolio, do you reduce channel discount because now you are putting more resources behind albuterol, sizing it or let us say that is a more phased out process.

The question is how do we grade this over a period of time considering the timing of the shift as well as considering what we believe could be the impact on several other businesses that we run. So one is the ability of the business we are transferring to their ability to absorb it, the second would be the ability of the transferring business to street and the timing in the market on when is the right time to do it. So I think there is nothing stopping us. It is a function of how we grade the transfer. I think on the margin piece, I will just say that it is a mixture, there is no, it is product to product. Sometimes margin corrections happen overnight, sometimes they happen an over a period of time depending on how much we think the equity of the product in the market is. And I think it is a function of both of these, but yes, the general trend is that you transfer, you kind of reduce margins and you take up your advertising spend to create demand.",

Look, when you pan out future launches and multiple variables which will shape those launches and incremental growth, in a market like US, over the 5-year time frame you are going to be right for some assumptions and you are probably not going to be right for some assumptions. So I think how competition would evolve, how pricing will evolve, how our ability to take share would increase in some pockets and all, see I think all these factors depend and eventually will determine where you will get into it, we feel that 300 to 500 is ambitious enough because our base that time was around 500 or so, when we spoke a year back. And as things stand today we have progressed well. The early indicators are quite positive. Our ability to take share, our ability to service the needs of the market, our ability to seamlessly ensure supply chain and compete wherever we have to compete in case of additional competition and most importantly the development and regulatory engine, I think everything is working fine, Surya. Now this is, the 300 to 500 is a congregation of several assets and some of those are filed, some of those are yet to be filed, some of those are quite ahead in the review process. So what we would not do probably is to attach any word whether conservative or not conservative, but what I am just saying, the external business environment and our ability to respond to it would shape up this opportunity and in our view it Cipla Limited January 25, 2022 is ambitious enough. There is no conservatism in anything. We are internally for every launch. We take it very seriously and very meaningfully and there is no conservatism. We go all out. What we avoid is getting very disruptive on pricing, I think. Our attempt is to be very responsible on pricing. So that is the only thing I would caveat and Yes, that is it.",

They maybe 30 million or 40 million in size or 20 million or between 20 to 50 million in size, but what happens is when you have an asset that does not come or asset disappoints in a late phase 3 trial, you have the ability to at least cover it up with something that is within your stable. So when we did tramadol et cetera, we didn’t have this pipeline backing. And now we are at a point wherein about a year and a half, two years we might have at least some of these assets closed to filing, they may not be big but at least they add the portfolio bit and momentum for our specialty journey.",

I think the days where you could do changed formulation or the addition of an excipients and re- launch the formulation, I mean those days are there but realistically the band that you get out of that is much lesser. So if you really want to bring more products and more innovative products into the more products which are patent protected and innovation driven, you have to partner with the multinational corporation is my view because there is no other way to get innovation into India. So it is a mix of both. It gives us growth and it is certainly driving growth for us, but it is also in my view, and also in absolute necessity because why would for example yesterday there was news that Novo Nordisk is launching the oral Semaglutide in the marketing India, now that is a great product. If it was not Novo themselves and supposing Novo would looking for a partner, many Indian companies would have offered the partner for this. The therapy is a game changer, right? So why would anyone sit out when there is innovation that we can bring to this market which can spurt the market growth and create the unmet need demand.",

So what happens is I don’t think the infrastructure requirement of launching products from innovators is anything new for the top 10 or 15 Indian companies, because everyone will have a cardiac field force, everyone will have a diabetic field force and every time there is a new product that comes in, I think this kind of eliminate the tail, all of us eliminate the tail of product that we are selling currently so that productivity is maintained.",

      "content": "Thanks Umang, for the introduction Over the last 24 months we have made significant progress across all our strategic priorities while navigating the uncertain trajectory of the pandemic. Our company recorded the highest revenue and achieved several major milestones in our One-India and U.S. business, pivoting the business on an accelerated growth and margin trajectory. In FY22, we continued the strong momentum across India, U.S. and other key markets, while continuing investments in portfolio and several other growth-linked initiatives. Cipla Limited May 10, 2022 Coming to the key highlights for the last quarter and full year FY22: Overall revenue for the quarter was Rs. 5,260 crore, recording a year-on-your growth of 14%. As you are aware, reverse seasonality kicks in during quarter 4, which impacts the overall business mix for the quarter. Despite that, weve been able to drive strong double digit revenue growth through focused execution and maintaining a high serviceability across our markets. The revenue growth for the full year was also at 14%. Excluding the COVID portfolio, the core revenue growth was a robust 12% for the quarter and for the full year. For the quarter, our One-India business across branded prescription, trade generics and consumer health recorded a robust 21% growth over the last year, and 15% adjusted for the COVID portfolio. We crossed the $1 billion milestone in our domestic-branded prescription business, driven by the sustained growth across our acute and chronic portfolios. In line with our One- India strategy, we have seen strong execution across portfolio and distribution synergies, helping us drive strong growth across the 3 businesses, which are now tracking close to the Rs. 10,000 crore mark. The strong equity of our brands amongst the patients and physicians is reflected in the high growth rates for our flagship brands, which are now a household name. Our focused growth-linked investments, coupled with top line leverage in our India consumer health business has led to EBITDA breakeven in FY22 for that business. And we wish to grow sustainably from here in FY23. Our efforts are now focused on identifying more brands with high consumer potential across India and South Africa to build a strong global wellness franchise. Im also pleased to see the transformation of the U.S. business, led by sustained ramp up in our respiratory franchise and the peptide injectables, which is improving the run rate and offsetting price erosion being witnessed in parts of our portfolio. Our U.S. core formulation sales stood at a multi-quarter high of $160 million, driven by strong traction in respiratory assets, as well as a contribution from the peptide portfolio. We are gearing up for the upcoming complex launches expected in H2FY23, which would drive both the top line growth as well as the operating profitability of our business. While the uncertainties and challenges related to the pandemic seem more manageable now, geopolitical conflicts and associated supply chain challenges have kept procurement and freight costs at elevated levels. We are managing some of these external headwinds by passing on cost escalations where possible, continued cost optimization and mix management to insulate the core margins to the extent possible. Our operating margins for this quarter subsume the impact of certain onetime charges to the extent of Rs. 200 crore, which I shall explain a little later; business mix due to reverse seasonality; elevated procurement and freight costs; as well as higher R&D investments driven by the initiation of the clinical trials of one respiratory asset which is almost Rs. 45 crore higher than the last year. Adjusted for these onetime charges, the core operating margins remain healthy at 18%, delivering a growth of 20% over last year quarter 4 with continued expansion in base business profitability. Cipla Limited May 10, 2022 The Rs. 200 crore onetime charges pertain to 2 items. The first item is an item related to an inventory charge on account of largely the COVID portfolio lying with us. And that is approximately Rs. 160 crore in the gross margin line and about Rs. 20 crore in the onetime operating expense line. Post this, we continue to carry marginal inventory, which we believe can be liquidated in the coming quarters. And hence, this quarters charge covers us for any material unforeseen risks of inventory in the future. We also have a charge in this quarter of about Rs. 20 crore, largely on account of the restructuring we have carried out in our South African business. Adjusting for these onetime charges, our core operating profitability was Rs. 960 cores and represented at over 18%, which is an expansion of 100 basis points versus last years quarter 4. Our reported gross margin after material cost stood at 59.2%. As alluded earlier, there is an approximate 300 basis point impact due to change in material cost line, largely pertaining to demand uncertainties linked to the COVID, which I have explained in terms of the Rs. 160 crore charge we have taken. Total expenses which include employee costs and other expenses stood at Rs. 2,364 crore, an increase by 12.3% on a sequential basis. Employee cost for the quarter stood at Rs. 892 crore, an increased by 2.3% versus the last quarter. The other expenses which include R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotion are at Rs. 1,471 crore, an increase by 19.4% sequentially given largely by the higher R&D expense as well as the onetime charges that we explained. Total R&D for the quarter is at 6.1% or Rs. 322 crore. The absolute trajectory remains intact with assets progressing in clinical trials and other portfolio developmental efforts ongoing. Reported EBITDA for the quarter was Rs. 763 crore, or 14.5% of sales. If we adjust for the Rs. 200 crore charges that we have spoken about, which are one-time, the EBITDA for the quarter then comes in at Rs. 960 crore with margins of 18% plus. Tax charge for the quarter stood at Rs. 71 crore. And the ETR was 15.9%. The lower ETR is attributed to the creation of a deff tax asset in our subsidiary, driven by the restructuring of certain businesses, which has been approved by the Board. The full year ETR is at 26.7%. Profit after tax (PAT) is at Rs. 362 crore or 6.9% of sales. Apart from the one-time charges above EBITDA, our PAT for the quarter includes the impact of the following 2 items: Nearly Rs. 70 crore of impairment in certain assets, largely on account of our investment in Avenue. The depreciation on account of the Sri Lankan currency versus the U.S. dollar, where we have booked a FOREX loss of Rs. 42 crore on account of the outstanding receivables from our subsidiary. We are closely monitoring the situation and exploring options to secure the future business. The adjusted PAT, excluding all of the one-off items in the P&L is nearly Rs. 610 crore or 11% of sales. Our reported pretax return on invested capital continues to track at a healthy rate of over 21.6%. As of 31st March 22, our long-term debt stands at ZAR720 million in South Africa and $7 million in Uganda. We had working capital loans of $49 million and EUR2 million. Cipla Limited May 10, 2022 These act as natural hedges towards our receivables. Driven by the relentless focus on cash generation and the rigor on cost discipline, we continue to be a net cash positive company as of March 22. And we continue to be appropriately hedged for few global currencies as per the policies. Our elevated inventory levels reflect our commitment to ensure availability of medicines and de-risk any business interruptions due to the global supply chain disruption. Ill now come to detailed business updates by market: We will start with India. In India, our One-India business grew by 27% for the year and 21% in the quarter. Core portfolio growth, excluding the COVID portfolio was 25% for the year and 15% for the quarter. The branded prescription business delivered sustained momentum across therapies in all our core portfolios. As per IQVIA MAT March 22, we continue to deliver market-beating growth on the overall portfolio and maintain healthy ranks and market share in key therapies. We have sustainably invested in our core electronic and acute portfolios to build high-quality formidable branded franchise with power brands which have shown a healthy CAGR of 13% over the FY18 to 22 period on the chronic side of our portfolio. Over the last 4 years, driven by focused product selection, our share of core chronic to core branded prescription has expanded by nearly 750 basis points. 23% of our overall branded prescription portfolio is under NLEM, and here too we continue to demonstrate a healthy 6% growth over the last 4 years. The trade generics business continues to witness strong demand traction for the flagship brands with strong order flow across regions. Our consumer health business has crossed Rs. 500 crore in FY22, and some of our flagship brands, which were transitioned have grown bigger and bolder. As alluded earlier, our India consumer health business has turned EBITDA breakeven in FY22, and we wish to grow that sustainably from here in FY23. Coming to the U.S. generics: The U.S. core formulation sales were at $160 million for the quarter and full year revenue stood at $594 million. In FY22, we have taken significant strides in transforming our portfolio footprint, adding more complex products and sensing our direct-to-market operations. Our respiratory franchise, including albuterol and Arformoterol is ramping up sustainably with 21% growth for the quarter and 28% for the full year. On the pipeline front, our Advair file is under active review, and we are hoping for a H2FY23 launch. As mentioned earlier, we have initiated clinical trials on the respiratory assets during the current quarter. And filings in the complex generics, including peptide injectables shall continue in FY23. Cipla Limited May 10, 2022 Coming to our SAGA business, which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and",

      "content": "The overall SAGA region grew by 8% on a year-on-year basis in dollar terms. The private business reported a robust 17% growth over the last year for the quarter in local currency terms. The growth continues to be diversified across base business and new launches. We continue to maintain our third position with a market share of 7.5% in the overall market. In markets outside South Africa, the CGA business has witnessed strong order flow in one of our key products, while the Sub-Saharan business-maintained scale over the last year base driven by continued order flow. Our international markets include emerging markets in Europe, and the business navigated very strong geopolitical headwinds to maintain scale at $385 million for the full year and a 4% growth for the quarter. Our DTM franchisees have delivered strong double- digit growth, which helps us offset the emerging market for its volatility and the muted B2B demand in Europe for the quarter. The business continues to track high margins and robust covenants and receivables during the year. Our operations in some of the emerging market geographies are facing currency headwinds, the impact of which is also baked in our Q4 numbers. We are closely monitoring the situation and exploring options to mitigate any risks that may arise. Turning now to our outlook: We have established a strong threshold for revenue and operating profitability in FY22 with core margins trending in the 21% to 22% range. Geopolitical crisis, which is contributing to the current inflationary environment has driven up procurement and trade expenses over the last years cost base. We are monitoring these trends closely and working on plans to mitigate these in the coming quarters. As we mitigate these challenges over the next 3 to 4 months, we expect the business trajectory to improve given the upcoming complex launches expected in the second half of this fiscal. Our near-term priorities include: Focus on monitoring and monetization of our respiratory filings and launches across geographies to accelerate our global lung leadership journey. Active advancement on innovative consumer-centric products to accelerate the augmentation of our global consumer wellness franchise across India and South Africa. Continued execution on our branded market portfolio, including peptides, brand building and improvement in ramp up productivity. Sustainable scale-up of our U.S. core formulation sales on the back of high serviceability of respiratory and peptide franchise. Continued focus on cost management, especially amid the inflationary environment we are, which is impacting our procurement costs and others. Accelerate the digital adoption across businesses and functions through focused agenda under the new digital health company Cipla Digital Health. And focus on regulatory compliance across our manufacturing facilities and implement globally benchmarked ESG practices.

And the fact that we were not able to spend it in quarter 3 on account of COVID-related. So, its not the new base.

But other than the existing pipeline, do you think we need to probably add more through some inorganic acquisitions so as to get to this number? Or the existing pipeline based on what is happening at the back end is good enough to give us this $300 million to $500 million? The reason is also because if I look at our balance sheet, the cash generation remains strong and with Advair, Abraxane, Revlimid, its only going to step up on.

And the second item there would be that if you are able to do that, then that cash will generate future returns because our internal return in the company is significantly higher than the return of putting this in the bank account.",

Anything that could be Rs. 500 crore in sale is also attractive to us as a portfolio. It has to fulfill a strategic need.

      "content": "Thank you Naveen. Good evening to all of you. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and well. We appreciate you joining us for our First Quarter Earning’s Call for financial 2023. I hope you have received the Investor Presentation that we have posted on our website. We will shortly release our integrated annual report of the financial year 2022. This is our 5th Integrated Annual Report and reflex our relentless focus on improving transparency, governance and setting best in class disclosure practices. I am pleased to share our Q1 FY 2023 performance which demonstrates strong commercial execution and continued investments and portfolio, sustainability and growth linked initiatives. Coming to the key highlights for the quarter: As anticipated, the incidence of severe COVID infections came down significantly and seemed more manageable with routine medication during Quarter 1 FY 2023. Consequently, the contribution from COVID products has normalized. Despite the normalization, we have been able to drive strong core revenue growth through focused execution operational efficiency and maintaining high serviceability across our markets. The overall revenue for the quarter was Rs.5,375 cores which was 2% lower than last year’s reported base and last year’s reported base included a strong contribution from COVID products. Excluding the COVID portfolio from last year, the core revenue growth was a healthy 6% for the quarter. Our reported operating Cipla Cipla Limited July 29, 2022 profitability for the quarter came in at 21.3% which is tracking in line with the full year 21%- 22% range, we guided to earlier. For the quarter, our One-India Business across the prescription, trade generics and consumer health. Our business has recorded a robust 9% year-on-year growth adjusted for the normalization in COVID portfolio over last year’s base. The COVID growth moment on last year’s high base reflects the strong equity of our flagship brands across key chronic therapies as well as in-clinic excellence and digital engagement. Big brands in our trade generic business maintained a healthy scale and our digital engagement across the channel partners continues to witness seamless traction. Our Global Consumer franchise continues to witness strong traction across brands in India and South Africa. The contribution of our Global Consumer franchise now stands at 9% of overall Cipla revenue for the quarter. With the vision to boost our wellness portfolio and diversify into the nutrient category we have acquired Endura Mass in July of year. Including this acquisition and our domestic consumer business under Cipla Health is well poised to achieve an annualized Rs. 600 crores franchise led by category expansion with new extensions coupled with sustainable growth in the operating profitability. Similarly brands with consumer potentials sitting in our prescription and trade generic stable in India and the OTC franchise in South Africa continued to deliver robust performance. Our US business continues to grow sustainably over the last year base with the steady momentum and overall portfolio and includes contribution from our respiratory and peptide products. In line with the operating environment, we experienced modest price erosion on the overall portfolio which is reflected in our run rates. We believe this impact will be offset by upcoming new launches scheduled for the later part of the year. The uncertainties and the challenges related to geopolitical conflicts and associated supply chain challenges continued through quarter 1 of the year keeping procurement and freight cost at very elevated levels. We have mitigated these incremental costs and the forex downside to certain extent via the price hikes, reflecting the strength and nature of our brands and business. Our API numbers for the quarter reflex normalization and scale. Last year, we spoke of a profit share on the commercial supply of an API to a partner, a good share which was recognized in the previous year’s quarter. This has also reflected in the operating profitability for the quarter at the company level which I will come to in a bit. Our report gross margins after material cost stood at 62.3% for the quarter which is broadly in line with last year’s figures. The gross margins for the quarter have baked in higher procurement freight and forex to the extent of 170 basis points which was offset by calibrated price hikes as well as the benefit of decline in the low margin COVID portfolio. Cipla Cipla Limited July 29, 2022 Total expenses which included employee cost and other expenses stood Rs.2,207 crores declining by 6.6% on a sequential basis, employee costs for the quarter stood at Rs. 956 crores an increase by 7% versus the last year’s quarter, mainly driven by increments. The other expenses which include R&D Regulatory Quality Manufacturing and Sales Promotion are at Rs.1,252 crores declining 15% sequentially driven by lower R&D spends, judicious promotional and growth limit investments. Total R&D is at Rs. 274 crores or5.1% of revenues. The absolute trajectory remains interact with assets progressing in clinical trials and portfolio developmental efforts on going. Reported EBITDA for the quarter was at Rs.1,143 crores or 21.3% of sales. On adjusting a normalization in the COVID portfolio and the API profit share from last year’s base; our core operating profitability for the quarter grew by 12%. As alluded earlier the reported 21.3% EBITDA margin has absorbed 170 basis point impact of elevated cost base as well as our forex changes to deliver a higher margin than last year. The 21.3% tracks closely to the guidance of the 21%-22% range for the full year 2023. Tax charge for the quarter stood at Rs. 268 crores and the effective rate was 27.5. Profit after tax was Rs.686 crores at 12.8% of revenue. As of 30th June, a long-term debt stands at ZAR720 million in South Africa and $7 million in Uganda. We also have working capital loans of $49 million, €3 million, GBP3 million and others; which act as natural edges towards our receivables. We have driven the relentless focus on generating cash and are continuing to focus on the rigorous discipline on cost. We continue to be appropriately hedged for key global currencies as per our policies. Coming to detailed updates for the quarter by market.: Our One India Core portfolio excluding the COVID products as we mentioned grew by 9% over the previous year. The branded prescription business demonstrated a 9% growth and we continued to maintain healthy racks and market share and key therapies. The Consumer Health business as we mentioned earlier is now EBITDA positive and we wish to grow this sustainably in the coming quarters there has been very strong sharp consumer in- sighting and strong on ground execution in this business. Over the last two years, we benefited from our strategic partnership with GoApptiv for digital solutions and channel. With our incremental investment, we hope to further widen updation for each via end-end brand marketing in channel engagement for the year 2-6towns. I am also pleased to announce our investment Achira Labs which has engaged in development and commercialization of point of care medical test kits in India. This partnership will propel Cipla Cipla Limited July 29, 2022 Cipla’s entry into the POC diagnostics and AMR space through the design, development and manufacturing of microfluidics-based technologies. This increases patient access to innovative. affordable and quality diagnostic solutions. Coming to US generics and leadership: The US core formulation sales for the quarter were $155 million and registered a growth of 10% on year-on-year basis. We continued to manage healthy market shares in our respiratory products despite price erosion. I alluded to earlier, that our DTM Respiratory Franchise continues to perform well and grew by 22% over last year and we have now reached the top three rank in terms of market share in the generic respiratory space. From a launch perspective, we have geared up for some of the upcoming complex launches and closely working with the US FDA and approval timelines. On the pipeline front, clinical trials and respiratory assets and filings on the complex Generics portfolio including our peptide injectable are on track. There is a slide in the investor deck that will you more details on the progress of the key assets across the respiratory, complex generics and peptide injectables. During the quarter we had a routine preapproval inspection at Indore for an ANDA file from the site. We received two minor observations and we have responded to the FDA. For our Goa Plant, we continue to work with the US FDA on inspection timelines. Coming to our SAGA business which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan and CGA: The overall SAGA region declined by 10% on year-on-year basis in dollar terms. The South Africa Private business experienced muted primarily sales growth in Q1 FY 2023 which is expected to recover in the coming quarter. Secondary terms from demand continues with our South Africa private market outperforming the industry. We continued to maintain a third position with the market share of 7.4% and grew by 10.6% versus 7% of the overall market as per IQVIA and MAT May 2022. In markets outside South Africa, the CGA business maintained it scale while the Sub- Saharan growth was driven by traction all across the region in $ terms. Our international market business grew by 18% year-on-year in dollar terms across the emerging markets in Europe. The grows numbers include the benefit of last year’s low base where we experienced timing deferrals pertaining to in-country currency allocation for Middle Eastern Supplies. We continue to closely monitor the volatile operating environment for currency and demand headwinds and explore options to mitigate risks and protect our margins. Our DTM franchise continue to deliver strong double growth which helps offset the emerging market forex volatility and muted B2B demand that we have seen. To summarize: • We are witnessing strong growth in our one India business despite the normalization in the COVID portfolio. • We see strong and steady momentum in our US portfolio and upcoming launches are on track. Cipla Cipla Limited July 29, 2022 • Our international market business continues to grow despite ongoing geopolitical volatility and • Our reported EBITDA margin of 21.3% with the elevated cost base baked in, tracks closely with our guidance of 21%-22% for the full year. On adjusting for the normalization in the COVID portfolio and API profit share in last year’s base, our core operating profitability for the quarter grew by 12%. Turning now to the outlook: • We do want to accelerate our growth in the One-India engine with sharp focus on building big prescription brands across chronic therapies driving accessibility to trade generic brands for unmet ailments and sustain expansion in our portfolio and wellness categories in our consumer wellness franchise. • We want to sustainably scale up US formulation business driven by the high serviceability of our current product portfolio and closely launching and monitoring upcoming high value launches in the second half of the year. • Continue our execution on branded and generic portfolio brand building and portfolio interventions in our emerging markets in South Africa business. • Very strong cost focus calibrated pricing actions and other interventions to navigate the inflationary headwinds that we are seeing on procurement and freight and • Focus on regulatory compliance across the manufacturing facilities and implementing globally benchmarked ESG practices. With this I would like to thank for your attention and we request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

However, the EBITDA margin guidance still remains kind of conservative at 21%-22%, where in we have a good niche launches lined up in second half any particular reason, you are kind of conservative on this guidance? Dinesh Jain Just to answer there, see the reason for that is that the freight cost and other procurement cost related increase, we expect it to continue for some period of time so therefore we want to, may be we are expecting that the launches will compensate for the increase and therefore we want to give guidance in this range only.",

In case the product is being manufactured by the partner do we buy the product and then sell it so we will have a revenue and a cost line item or we directly sell it and there is a percentage of profit coming in which will directly go to EBITDA against our R&D investments?",

      "content": "Thank you, Naveen. Thank you, Steve, and good evening to all of you. First of all, Im pleased to join Cipla Limited as Global CFO and honored to be part of companys rich legacy of “Caring For Life.” On the quarter results, I hope youve received the “Investor Presentation” that we posted on our website. For Cipla, the last three months have been tremendous learning in terms of navigating the business amid the ongoing geopolitical headwinds, while continuing to make progress across all our strategic priorities. In a continuing volatile macro and geopolitical environment, we are very pleased to report historically the highest quarterly revenue of Rs.5,829 crores. The overall revenue growth for the quarter was at 6% on a reported basis, and a strong 12% on a COVID adjusted base of last year. We continue to service demand across all our markets and demonstrate robust commercial execution of new launches during the quarter. This was achieved despite a challenging operating environment and helped us deliver a robust EBITDA margin of over 22% for the quarter on a reported basis, and approximately 24% on an adjusted basis. On these adjustments, Ill come to later. Cipla Limited November 4, 2022 Coming to key highlights of the quarter, the core revenue growth was driven by sustained momentum in One India Business and differentiated portfolio unlocking in the US. Our global inventory levels reflect our commitment to ensure the continuity of supply given the headwinds in the sourcing environment. Our free cash flow generation and operating efficiency continue to drive a strong net cash position. Our operating margins of 22.3% for the quarter subsume the impact of sharp moderation in COVID contribution in last years phase and geopolitical uncertainties. As alluded earlier, the demand for COVID products is negligible in line with sharp drop in new infections. Accordingly, we have taken an inventory charge on all of the marginal COVID inventory we were carrying and were expecting to liquidate, which is in the materials cost line item in the P&L. Adjusted for this, our EBITDA margin would have been higher by nearly 150 basis points, or at approximately 24%. The higher R&D costs investments driven by ongoing clinical trials on respiratory asset as well as other developmental asset, is higher by Rs.61 crore versus last year, which is incremental 1% of our revenue. Our reported gross margin after materials cost stood at 63% for the quarter, which is 165 basis points above last years figures driven by contribution from new launches and overall mix change. As alluded earlier, reported gross margin subsumes the impact of inventory charge in the material cost line item. Total expenses which include employee cost and other expenses stood at Rs.2,366 crores which has increased by 7.2% on sequential basis. Employee cost of the quarter stood at Rs.951 crores flat on sequential basis. The other expenses which includes R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotions, are at Rs.1,405 crores, increased by 12.3% sequentially driven mainly by higher R&D cost, which I talked about which is up 22% YoY, judicious promotional and growth-linked investments. Total R&D investment for the quarter are at Rs.335 crores of 5.8% of revenue. The absolute trajectory remains intact with assets progressing in clinical trials and other portfolio developmental efforts continuing. Reported EBITDA for the quarter was at Rs.1,302 crores, or 22.3% as I pointed earlier. The reported growth over last years base was 6%. On adjusting the one-time COVID inventory charge, our core operating profitability for the quarter was approximately 24% or at Rs.1,389 crores. At the current run rate, we are tracking in line with our full year guidance of 21% to about 22%. The profit after tax is at Rs.789 crores or at 13.5% of sales. As of 30th September 2022, our long-term debt primarily constitutes ZAR720 million in South Africa and working capital of $49 million in the US apart from some of the other facilities that Cipla Limited November 4, 2022 we have in other geographies, Driven by our relentless focus on cash generation and rigor in cost discipline, we continue to be net cash-positive company at the end of this quarter. Importantly, we are constantly monitoring the current macroeconomic situation and proactively addressing the risks, including any FOREX downside impacting our revenue and profit and inflation as is yet. To close, we saw robust momentum across portfolio and geographies for H1. Growth levers in the subsequent quarters will include continued growth momentum across branded and consumer business in India and South Africa, robust traction in our North America franchise across complex portfolio and continued contribution from respiratory and peptide to product, and thirdly monitoring geopolitical headwinds, driving elevated procurement, freight costs and foreign exchange depreciation-led, translation loss in INR. Id like to now hand over to Umang for Business and Operational Performance. Thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you, Ashish, and welcome to all of you on the call. Our Q2 FY23 performance reflects strong execution in our One India and a solid launch momentum from our differentiated US portfolio, driving our overall revenue to a multi-quarter high of Rs.5,829 crores. The reported growth is 6% and 12% year-on-year after adjusting for COVID in our Q2 FY22 base. Ashish has already explained the numbers to you. Our core business continues to demonstrate sustained momentum despite the impact of geopolitical headwinds. Im pleased to share that our reported EBITDA margins for the quarter came in at 22.3% and adjusted margins at approximately 24% which continues to track in line with our guided range of 21% to 22% EBITDA. Coming to the Detailed Updates for the quarter by market. In a One India franchise, we are making strategic bold moves, transforming into a holistic ecosystem driven by new science, better reach and a digital-first approach. We are significantly investing in investments in portfolio, diagnostics, channel and digital initiatives. Our global consumer franchise continues to witness strong traction across India and South Africa. The overall franchise now stands at 9% of the overall Cipla revenue for the quarter. There is a slide on our investor deck that captures some of these distinctive structures and winning capabilities being added to fortify our One India franchise under the Wellness theme as well. For this quarter, the One India core portfolio deliver a 6% year-on-year reported growth despite the continued normalization of COVID contribution compared to the quarter in the last year. After adjusting for COVID products, revenue growth stood at a robust 15% year-on-year, reflecting strong demand traction across our therapies and our businesses. The branded prescription business demonstrated double-digit growth across therapies and core portfolio driven by continued demand. The market beating growth trajectory continued for the sixth consecutive quarter with 15% growth for the quarter on an ex-COVID basis. This core Cipla Limited November 4, 2022 revenue growth is underpinned by a healthy mix of price, volume and contribution from new launches. During the quarter, we launched eight new brands in Cardiology, Diabetes, Urology, Gynecology and Respiratory. As per IQVIA MAT September 22, we continue to maintain healthy ranks and market share in all our key therapies. The trade generics business continues to witness strong traction across the flagship brands with steady order flow from the tier-two-to-six rural towns and the demand fulfillment across regions translating into double-digit growth over last year. Our launch momentum continued with 10 products in key therapies within the generics franchise. Our consumer health business continues to do well and is tracking well in line with the Rs.600 crores plus annualized revenue, we alluded to previously. The transferred brands are tracking at a robust 14% growth momentum during the quarter, with the overall business delivering over 20% growth versus last year. Coming to US Generics and Lung Leadership Franchise. The US core formulations sales for the quarter registered a high of $179 million. This is a 25% growth year-on-year. Our continued focus on driving business through strong execution of our differentiated pipeline is demonstrated by the launch of Lenalidomide in this quarter. Were committing to maintain sustainable supplies and maximize value. The contribution of differentiated dosage forms in our North America Generics portfolio continues to expand which translated into this 15% growth over the quarterly average run rate of 155 million over the last three quarters. Our generic market shares in respiratory products continue to be healthy. Market share for Albuterol and Arfomoterol stood at 16% and 38% respectively as per IQVIA MAT ending September 30, 2022. Our peptide franchise continues to track well since its launch in Q4 of FY22. Lanreotide 505(b)(2) has steadily gained market share with 4.6% share in Q1, which was last quarter moving to 9.6% in this quarter. We are tracking to our earlier guidance of reaching 15%-odd percent market share by the end of this year in this category. On the pipeline front, clinical trials on the respiratory assets and filings on complex generics, including the peptide injectables are on track. From the launch perspective, we have geared up for some of the upcoming launches and closely working to secure our approvals. We have proactively responded to the FDAs observations issued for our inspection of the Goa plant in August 22. As part of our business derisking practices, we had already initiated plans Cipla Limited November 4, 2022 to derisk some of our key assets. At this stage, we do not expect any material impact to our planned launches for FY23. We will continue to share material updates as the situation unfolds. Coming to SAGA, which includes South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and the CGA. As alluded earlier, the South Africa private business demonstrated continued recovery on a sequential basis. In secondary terms, strong demand continues with our South Africa private business outperforming our market by over two times. We continue to maintain the third position with a market share of 7.5% and grew by 7.2% versus a market growth of 2.8% as per IQVIA MAT August 22. Our international markets business despite the challenging operating environment and FOREX volatility, maintained scale over last years COVID base. Our reported numbers in dollar terms also subsumed the adverse impact of a depreciating euro, the British pound and other local currencies against United States dollar, which is offsetting the healthy double-digit secondary growth across our DTA markets. We continue to monitor this volatile operating environment for currency and demand headwinds and are proactively exploring options to mitigate risks and protect them. To close, adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 24% for the quarter tracks above our 21% to 22% guidance range. Unlocking of our complex pipeline while balancing incremental R&D investments in future is in progress and we are committing to accelerating our return on capital employed, which is currently tracking at a healthy 20% for the 12-months period in line with our commitment of 17% to 20% range. Turning now to our Outlook, our near-term priorities include accelerating the growth in the One India engine with building big prescription brands across chronic therapies, driving accessibility of the trade generics brands, and a sustained portfolio expansion in the wellness categories. Sustainable scale up in the US business driven by maximizing contribution from complex upcoming launches. And this includes our respiratory and peptide products. Continued execution in the branded and generics portfolio across our DTM markets in the emerging side of the world and SAGA, continued focus on cost, and offsetting the cost inflation through calibrated pricing actions and other interventions to navigate the procurement freight and other cost inflation we have seen, and a focus on regulatory compliance across our manufacturing facilities, and implementing globally benchmarked ESG practices. I would like to thank you for your attention, and request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

The competitor is doing Cipla Limited November 4, 2022 almost kind of $100 million. So, is this more or less in line with the kind of agreement with the innovator or there has been some amount of kind of production or the supply chain management which has led to this difference, if you could clarify?",

And the other is that with the launches in the US, etc., so there was an increase in the debtors. So, of course, that cash release will happen over this quarter and the next. So, thats broadly on the cash flow. On the strategic priorities, of course, we are constantly discussing various capital allocation priorities, which includes both investment into new line of businesses, as well as looking at some of the opportunities that are available in the market to grow some of our existing businesses, and there are capex proposals as well, which could be towards more modernization of our facilities, or reducing cost, etc., But I would like Umang to come in out here as well.",

But we dont subscribe to the breadth model of assets, where we do more projects necessarily. So, in that way, we keep a watch on how much were investing in R&D. I think specialty projects, we have a few in our pipeline as they begin to gain steam, the R&D spending will go up. As it will go up as biosimilar programs advance. So, long term trends, we have said, we cant afford R&D higher than seven in our financial model. And as these expenditures begin to ramp up, I think thats roughly where we will go.",

If you were to look at our trade generics business and our branded business, both are growing… the branded business is almost 60% to 70% of our India business, and thats growing at the same rate as perhaps the trade generics business.

So, overall, on the cost side, I think weve been able to maintain that discipline through certain actions from our side, even if we are seeing some trend outside to ensure that we are able to maintain our margins. On the forex, I think already Umang has covered, we have certain imports, and we have certain underlying currencies in some of the markets that we have, right.

Cipla really changed its model to get into its own front-end sometime in 2015, 16 time period. And thats when we started Albuterol, Advair journey. And it took us this six, seven years to launch.

So this quarter, we actually witnessed strong performance across all our core businesses with expansion in the profitability, despite increase in the R&D investments. The quarterly performance reflects sustained momentum, in our branded markets and contribution from our differentiated launches, in the US. And this was amid the challenging macro environment and SAGA missing our internal estimates. While procurement cost remains escalated, but freight cost has improved sequentially, responding to lower rates and improving logistics mix, which is quite reassuring. Coming to the highlights of the quarter. Overall, we are pleased to report a quarterly revenue of Rs. 5,810 crores. The overall revenue growth for the quarter was at 6% Y-o-Y on a reported basis and a COVID-adjusted basis in comparison to last year, a strong 11% growth. Our One India franchise grew in healthy double digits on an ex COVID basis and the North American business reported the highest ever quarterly revenue, driven by traction in the differentiated portfolio, including market share expansion in key respiratory and peptide injectable products. Our free cash flow generation and operating efficiency continue to drive our healthy net cash position. Our reported RoIC for the trailing 12 month stood at 19.7% which was towards the higher end of the range that our long-term target of 17% to 20%. In line with our expectation, EBITDA margins stood at robust 24%+ for the quarter, on a reported basis. The reported EBITDA growth is 13% Y-o-Y and 24%, if adjusted for COVID, in the base year. Cipla Limited January 25, 2023 Our EBITDA margins for the quarter subsumes the impact of lower-than-anticipated SAGA performance, a higher inflationary market and a higher R&D outlay. Higher R&D investments was driven by ongoing clinical trials on a respiratory asset, as well as other developmental efforts, including contribution to biosimilar JV. Total R&D expense was higher by Rs. 100+ crores versus last year, which is incremental 1.75% of our revenue and part of our profitability business plan. Our reported gross margin after material costs stood at 65.5% for the quarter, which is 450 basis points above last years figures, driven by contribution from new launches and overall mix change. Total expenses, which include employee costs and other expenses, stood at Rs. 2,398 crores, increased by about 1.4% on sequential basis. Employee costs for the quarter stood at Rs. 949 crores, which was flat. The other expenses, which includes R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotions are at Rs. 1,450 crores, increased by 3.2% sequentially, driven by, like I said, R&D expense, which was also followed up with judicious promotional and growth-linked investments. Total R&D investment for the quarter are at Rs. 363 crores or 6.2% of revenues. The absolute trajectory remains intact, with assets progressing into clinical trials and other portfolio developmental effort continuing. We expect our absolute R&D investment to inch up gradually from these levels in the coming quarters. Profit after tax is at Rs. 801 crores or at 13.8% of sales. The PAT for the quarter subsumes one- time charge of reversal of deferred tax assets as we revisit our plan for one of our subsidiaries. The adjusted PAT is Rs. 876 crores, which is more normalized or 15.1% of sales. The adjusted growth rate over last year is 20%, and adjusted ETR would be 27.5%, which is more normalized. As of 31st December, 2022, our long-term debt primarily constitutes ZAR 720 million in South Africa and working capital loan of about $49 million in the US. Driven by our relentless focus on cash generation and rigor on cost discipline, we continue to be net cash positive company as of December 2022. To close, we saw robust momentum across portfolio and geographies for the year, till now. Our growth levers in the subsequent quarter will include: continuing market-beating growth in India, across all three categories of prescription, trade generics and consumer health. Full year operating profitability in line with our guidance of 21% to 22%; robust traction in North America portfolio, with continued contribution from respiratory and peptides; incubate and drive, growth in stable geographies in international markets, with focus on growth in core markets and managing the growth in EM markets; and we continue to monitor the geopolitical headwinds, that have ebbed but still continues. I would now like to hand over to Umang to talk about the business and operational performance. Thanks. Cipla Limited January 25, 2023",

      "content": "Thank you, Ashish, and good evening to all of you. Welcome to our call today evening. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of performance, which demonstrates robust commercial execution and continued investments, in our portfolio and growth-oriented initiatives. Our Q3 FY 23 performance reflects continued momentum across our businesses of One India and US and has a moderation of the SAGA region coming in lower than our internal estimates. Developmental efforts on delivering a robust future pipeline, investment in capacity creation and high rigor on compliance, including our de-risking efforts, continue to be our top key focus areas. To accelerate our innovation journey, we also invested in a critical partnership this quarter, to support development in therapies, which are future innovation levers for Cipla. During the quarter, we initiated our investment into a JV focused towards building the biosimilar pipeline. We also partnered with Ethris GmbH for the development of mRNA-based therapies and this fast-tracks Ciplas participation in cutting-edge healthcare solutions to patients. On our journey to build the consumer health franchise in India and South Africa, we continue our growth driven by new launches, category innovation and actionable consumer insights. Our India consumer franchise grew by 14% year-on-year in INR terms over the last year after adjusting for the acquisition, we made in Q2 FY 23. And the global consumer franchise, including South Africa, now stands at close to 9% of overall Cipla revenue for the quarter. Were expecting the India consumer franchise to be nearly Rs. 1,100 crores, by the end of this year. Coming to detailed updates for the quarter by market, Our One India segment, the One India core portfolio delivered a 11% year-on-year growth, after adjusting for the COVID contribution in last year base. The double-digit growth reflects solid traction in big brands as well as contribution from launches in the focused chronic categories during the year. Our branded prescription business demonstrated double-digit growth in chronic therapies, in the core portfolio, driven by continued demand. The market-in beating growth trajectory continued for the seventh consecutive quarter, with the 11% growth significantly higher, than the market growth rate. The core revenue growth is underpinned by a healthy mix of price, volume and contribution, from new launches. And as per IQVIA December 22, we continue to maintain healthy ranks, in market share in key therapies for the quarter. Our growth in respiratory, cardiac and anti-diabetic therapies, outperformed the market, and overall chronic share has expanded by 240 basis points, over last year and now stands at 60% of mix, for the quarter. We now have more than 21 brands, which have revenues greater than Rs. 100 crores, in the trailing 12 months as compared to 19 in the corresponding previous period as per IQVIA December 22. Our trade generics business continues to witness strong volume traction, strengthening our leadership in the trade generics segment, in India. The revenue growth for the quarter reflects, a steady order flow from the Tier 2 to Tier 6, in rural towns and demand fulfillment across regions, Cipla Limited January 25, 2023 translating into sustained scale-up in our flagship brands. We launched over 10 products, and therefore, the launch momentum continued in key therapies such as cardiac, antidiabetic and injectable dosage forms. Our consumer health business continued to deliver consistent growth across anchor and emerging brands, translating into the growth, we had mentioned earlier. We now have four brands, in well- entrenched categories, scaling up over Rs. 100 crores in revenue under a trailing 12 month basis. Coming to our US generics portfolio. The US core formulation sales for the quarter was the highest at $195 million, registering a robust 30% growth on a year-on-year basis. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of growth, demonstrating an increasing share in our respiratory peptides and differentiated launches like lenalidomide. The sales of lenalidomide incidentally, are marginally lower than the previous quarter. We continue to keep market well supplied and focus on maximizing value, from all our new launches. Our peptide franchise continues to track well with lanreotide, steadily gaining market share to 14.1% as of November 22 end. We are on track to achieve our 15% guidance, in this category. We have also launched leuprolide depot, during the quarter, which expands our peptide franchise further. We continue to maintain this launch momentum, in the next fiscal and after. Our generic market shares in respiratory products have witnessed expansion in the last 12 months, driven by sustainable supplies and competitive cost position. The total market share for Albuterol and Arformoterol, stood at 18% and 39%, respectively, as per IQVIA week ending December 31st, 2022. On the pipeline front, clinical trials on respiratory assets and filings on complex generics, including peptide injectables are on track. From a launch perspective, weve responded to the queries on the Advair file and are working closely with the USFDA on the approval. We have been proactively communicating with the FDA on the Goa observations as remediation efforts continue at the site. We continue to focus efforts on derisking our key assets from the site and well share material updates, as the situation evolves. We believe our North America franchise will witness continued growth, on the back of new launches. Coming to our international markets business, we continue to drive superior local market growth and navigate a challenging operating environment, in forex volatility. While excluding COVID growth in INR terms is 6% for the quarter, our reported dollar numbers subsumed the adverse impact of depreciating local currencies against the US dollar, which is offsetting the healthy double-digit secondary growth, we are seeing across our DTM markets. Coming to our SAGA region, as alluded earlier, the South Africa private business is recovering from a reconfiguration of supply and an evolving business mix between, private and tender. In secondary terms, the strong demand continues for our South Africa private business, which Cipla Limited January 25, 2023 outperformed the market growth. We continue to maintain our third market position, with a market share of 7.7%, and the business did come in lower than our internal estimates this quarter. Our EBITDA margin of over 24%, for the quarter tracks well above the 21% to 22% guidance range, for the full year. We expect our overall quarter 4 margins to moderate, with seasonality. We are encouraged by and committed to maintain the high strong launch momentum, in the coming fiscal and continue investments, in developing a robust pipeline across the categories of respiratory, peptide, complex generics and biosimilars. We are committed to accelerating our return on capital employed, which is currently tracking closer to 20%. Turning now to our outlook. Our near-term priorities include: accelerating growth in our One India engine, with a sharp focus on building big prescription brands across chronic therapies; driving accessibility to trade generics as well as our global wellness franchise. Sustainable scale-up of our US formulations business, driven by maximizing contribution, from complex launches and maintaining the high serviceability of our product families. Continued execution on branded and generic portfolio brand building, portfolio interventions and launch excellence across our DTM and emerging markets. Continued cost focus, calibrated pricing actions and other interventions to navigate inflationary procurement, freight and other cost elements and maintaining a consistent upward RoIC trajectory, and continued rigor on regulatory compliance across manufacturing facilities and implementing globally benchmarked ESG practices. I thank you for your interest in Cipla and your attention and will request the moderator to open the session for Q&A.",

Private, whats happened is, though we are growing faster than the market, the overall market growth is also shrunk. Then I think, this is a post-COVID readjustment thats happening in the supply chains there. I think stock levels of customers are going falling a bit to accommodate this. And so I think the supply chain is getting reconfigured a bit. So my guess is this is the worst is probably in our numbers over the last two quarters.

And this growth has come across actually chronic therapies as well as in respiratory, where weve grown much faster than the market, which is our core therapy.

So, if you look at South Africa, market growth has reduced, over the base of the previous year. And obviously, the global situation does not help. However, our business has always outgrown the market growth. And I think that will continue going forward. But we have some issues in terms of just the market readjusting the amount of supply it needs for its growth. And I think thats currently happening. As I mentioned, I think the worst is over from a growth perspective over the last two, 2.5 quarters.

      "content": "Thank you, Ajinkya. Good evening to all of you and I appreciate your joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call for financial year 23. I hope you have received the investor presentation that weve posted on our website. Im pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress across our strategic priorities. In fiscal year 23, we recorded the highest ever revenue and EBITDA, including several major milestones in our One India and U.S. businesses, pivoting our business on an accelerated growth and a strong margin trajectory. We also continue to invest capital across multiple growth initiatives, including investments in the complex pipeline in new science into our big brands and expanding our consumer portfolio among others. I would like to cover some key themes that have played out in our financial performance for the last year. One of the key themes is delivering market-beating growth in our focus markets of India, South Africa, United States and some of the large emerging markets. Our India branded prescription business delivered sustained momentum across all our therapies, achieving 13% excluding COVID year-on-year growth while the IPM growth was 8% as per IQVIA at March 23. Importantly, our overall share of chronic therapies expanded year-on-year by 300 basis points to 59% of the total portfolio, an 80 basis points increase in the market share from -- in the market Cipla Limited May 12, 2023 share for the chronic therapies from 7.5% to 8.3%. We do not expect the NLEM pricing impact to influence our growth significantly as it will be balanced via allowed price increases and continued volume growth. This business has consistently posted market beating growth for 2 consecutive years as per IQVIA. In South Africa, Cipla grew at a 3-year CAGR of 8.9% faster than the market, which is growing at 4.4%. Our focus continues on driving market-leading growth and increasing our share in the market of South Africa. I will cover the U.S. market subsequently. Within India, the other focus area for us has been growing our big brands across all our businesses. In India branded generic, we now have 21 brands featuring in the top 300 brands and which are over INR100 crores of sales as per MAT March 23. In our trade generics business, we have 8 brands that are above INR50 crores of sales and are much larger in volume terms catering to the length and breadth of the country. Cipla Health has successfully transitioned and consumerized some of the existing brands into megabrands with sales of over INR100 crores. This has been achieved through leveraging brand strength to its maximum deepening market penetration, significantly higher consumer-oriented packaging and positioning. Our India consumer franchise is already tracking at INR1,000 crores plus on an annual basis, and we expect the EBITDA margin to move closer to mid-teens in FY 24 and grow sustainably from there on. Id now like to talk a little bit about our U.S. market. One of our core themes has been to broaden our pipeline in this market. We are pleased to share that our U.S. business has crossed $200 million for the first time in this quarter. The full year for this business stood at $733 million, growing over 23% from last year. This has been achieved through our pipeline and execution. We had announced a peptide pipeline earlier in FY 23, and this has added a new muscle of institutional capability and portfolio, which we aim to further enhance. Our lead asset of lanreotide now has 17% share in this market. While launches are a focus area for all markets, noteworthy of the 50-plus launches in India, trade generics market and the 32 brands launched across multiple therapies in South Africa. This new leg of revenue in South Africa is likely to offset the reduction in the tender business and the margin pressures we have seen recently. We continue to invest in growth franchisees. In line with our strategy to continue our focus on expanding our One India franchise towards the higher share of chronic therapies, we recently signed a perpetual license agreement with Novartis for Galvus and its combination brands, which, as per MAT March 23 IQVIA had reported sales of nearly INR270 crores. This will be a strong strategic fit to strengthen our IBDs portfolio. We also entered into a strategic partnership to market and distribute Scapho, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of psoriasis. In Cipla Health, we acquired Endura MASS, a renowned nutritional supplement, which has a niche positioning in this market. While we continue to invest in brands, we also focused investments in enhancing people capabilities Cipla Limited May 12, 2023 in the field force. In -- over the last 2 years, our field force in India has grown by over 800 people. Our R&D investment continues to increase. In terms of pipeline, weve made significant progress on initiation of trials across some of our complex products. On the pipeline front, we have 3 differentiated products undergoing clinical trials with filings targeted in FY 24. Our last but most clinical theme has been to derisk our U.S. portfolio. Our U.S. supply continues to be well diversified across all our sites and partner sites in -- and partner sites from our partners. On our compliance front, at Fall River, Massachusetts, we recently completed the CGMP audit, which resulted in 0483 observations. We have approval to produce our respiratory assets in this facility. Respiratory assets are being derisked to this in-house facility. For Indore, we expect classification by mid-May. However, we do not see any risk to commercialize product portfolio. Generic Advair is already being derisked to another in-house facility. Remediation efforts are ongoing for our Goa facility, and we expect a CAPA completion by end of Q1. Reinspection is required for plant clearance, which is being targeted for quarter 3. Our generic Advair file is now solely dependent on the facility approval, having cleared all other questions from the agency. We have already commenced the derisking process for this product, as I mentioned earlier, to our other in-house facility. The value stays intact as no new generic is expected before we launch. Nanopaclitaxel is being used, as I mentioned earlier, to a partner CMO site, and exhibit batches are being taken. We expect to be able to supply from 2 sites by fiscal year 25. We dont see any change to the value of this product as well as there are clearly no generic launches till date. With this, I would now like to invite Ashish to present the financial and operational performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Umang. This quarter, we witnessed strong performance across all our core businesses with overall expansion and profitability. The quarter reflects our consistent performance in One India with better than market growth and our performance in our differentiated product launches in U.S., which was done earlier this year. Coming to the key financial highlights for the quarter. Overall, we are pleased to report a quarterly revenue of INR5,739 crores, with full year revenue closing at INR22,753 crores. The overall revenue growth for the quarter was at 9% Y-o-Y on a reported basis and on ex-COVID basis, a strong 14% growth. And for the full year, the same number on a Y-o-Y growth stands at 5% on reported and 11% on ex-COVID basis. Our One India franchise further expanded its market share in a traditionally weak seasonal quarter by growing at healthy 16% on an ex-COVID basis on back of extended countrywide flu season. The North America business reported a highest ever revenue driven by traction in the differentiated portfolio with revenue of $733 million, growing at 23% Y-o-Y. Our free cash flow generation and operating efficiency continue to drive our healthy net cash position. Our reported ROIC for the trailing 12 months stood at about 24%, which is over our long-term range of 17% to 20% that weve talked about earlier. In line with our expectation, Cipla Limited May 12, 2023 EBITDA margins stood at 20% plus for the quarter on a reported basis, whereas we ended full year at robust 22%. This EBITDA margin is not including other income. Our EBITDA margins for the year subsumes the impact of lower-than-anticipated SAGA performance, a high inflationary market and a higher R&D spend and certain COVID provisioning. Adjusted for COVID, the margin for the full year stood at 23%. Higher R&D investments driven by ongoing clinical trials on differentiated assets, as well as other developmental efforts, including contribution to biosimilar JV was higher in the quarter by 15% versus last year and is part of our profitability model. Our reported gross margin after materials costs stood at 64% for the quarter, which is 480 basis points above last years figures, driven by contribution from new launches and overall mix change. As you may recall, last year, we had onetime COVID charge of inventory provision in quarter 4, which had impacted the reported gross margins. Total expenses for the quarter, including employee costs and other expenses, which stood at INR4,565 crores, up by 3.7% on a sequential basis. The other expenses, which includes R&D, regulatory, quality, manufacturing and sales promotions are at INR1,537 crores, increased by 6.1% sequentially, driven by judicious promotional and growth link investment. Total R&D investment for the quarter are at INR371 crores, about 6.5% of revenue and were 15% higher, like I said, on a Y-o-Y basis. R&D expense for the full year stood at INR1,344 crores, which includes material cost, depreciation, etcetera, etcetera. Profit after tax for the quarter is at INR526 crores or 9.2% of sales, adjusting for onetime impairment charge on account of divestment of certain noncore assets in Africa and Middle East, adjusted PAT stood at INR708 crores, which is 12.3% of sales. The adjusted growth rate over last year is 436 basis points and adjusted ETR, effective tax rate, is at 24%. Full year PAT is at INR2,802 crores while adjusted PAT is INR2,984 crores to 13.1% of sales. As of March 23, our debt primarily constitutes ZAR 720 million in South Africa. We have repaid our working capital loans of about $50 million in the U.S. given the interest cost environment. Turning now to our outlook. We established strong threshold for revenue growth and operating profitability with core margins trending in the 22% range. To close, we saw robust momentum across portfolio and geographies for FY 23. The growth levers in the subsequent quarters will include continued market beating growth across One India, prescription, trade generics and consumer health. Full year operating profit in line with our guidance of about 22%, which includes continued investment in R&D programs. Robust traction in our North America franchise across complex portfolio and continued contribution from respiratory and peptide products, creating a more resilient business through de-risk portfolio and supply. And lastly, incubate and drive growth in stable geographies in international market. I would now like to thank you for your attention and will request the operator to open the Q&A.

How should we read this because, lets say, for Revlimid, if I talk then for a specific set of prescription amount of your competitors would have reported a much higher number, and we have booked relatively much lesser.

Were also seeing a very strong growth on our generics business in this side of the market. And I think on the Tier 1 markets, we are seeing a trend where therapies are getting upscaled, which means that if somebody is taking, for example, a diabetes drug, which was an oral theyre now migrating to perhaps take obesity drugs and better diabetes drugs that could be injected, right, which are slightly more costlier. So were seeing this migration constantly in Tier 1 towns, where people are moving up the therapy ladder. And in Tier 2 to 6 towns, we are seeing pretty - - a deepening of health care.

So thats one area of investment. The second investment will be happening in our consumer plans business, right? That also takes from the time you invest till the time you begin to see higher growth, it is -- there is a lead lag effect. Then also, R&D is constantly investing. Weve got 3 clinical trials going on. Weve got 2 respiratory products that is fairly significant as a clinical outlay for the products to get to market. Thats number three. And number four, are some of the initiatives on our biosimilars, etcetera. So I think all across we are not wanting the business to get impacted by the lack of investment. And the other thing, like we mentioned on an earlier call, we would much rather invest for a higher top line growth if we are at the 22%, 23% margin level as against push margin to 24% and compromise top line growth.",

So I think we went back at that point in time, and we reconfigured our strategy to say that even if we acquire an asset, which is in late clinics, we must have our own pipeline to add to it. And the time distance between -- I mean, the time difference between when our pipeline comes to market and when we add an in-licensed assets should not be more than 2 years. Because otherwise, its very difficult to have to make the business productive. So what weve been doing over the last 2 years, ever since weve had that negative news on IV Tramadol is actually being investing in creating our own internal pipeline. These are not products that are going to be $100 million or $200 million in sales, but we may have 2, 3 products that could well be $20 million to $50 million in sales. So lets say, we invest in this for another year. And if we have a sizable pipeline of 2, 3 products with the revenue profile of $30 million to $40 million, thats the time where this business can then begin to build out for the future. So its still about a year away from that vantage point, but weve gone back, retooled strategy and are investing in developing our own internal pipeline. Cipla Limited May 12, 2023",

I hope you have received the investor presentation that we have posted on our website. We have also released our sixth integrated annual report for financial year 2023. This report continues to be a reflection of our commitment and focus towards improving transparency, governance and setting best-in-class disclosure practices. Im pleased to share our quarter one FY 24 performance, which demonstrates strong commercial execution, sustainability, and growth in our focused markets. Now Ill cover the key highlights for the quarter. In quarter one FY 24, we recorded a solid 18% year-on-year growth across all markets. We have record revenue in both our flagship businesses of One India and the US. Our One India branded prescription business grew faster than the IPM as per IQVIA MAT June 23, driven by growth in chronic portfolio.US continues to scale new peaks by posting the highest ever revenue for the quarter once again on the back of momentum in our differentiated portfolio. In South Africa, the Private Market business has strongly bounced back from a challenging FY 23, posting double- digit growth in prescription and OTC segments. South Africa prescription business is now ranked second by market share in the country as per IQVIA MAT May 23. With a strong revenue growth, Q1 FY 24 witnessed a strong EBITDA margin at 23.6%, largely driven by mix and efficiency in operations. In this quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet further and in line with our strategy. We continue to allocate our capital towards multiple growth initiatives, complex pipeline, new science, big brands, and expansion of our consumer portfolio to make this growth sustainable for the longer term. Cipla Limited July 26, 2023 I would now like to cover further details on our focus markets, which powered the growth for this quarter. Our India branded prescriptions business continued its market beating growth trajectory with a sustained momentum across all therapies by growing significantly higher than the IPM growth as per MAT June 23. Our share of chronic therapies in our revenue share grew from 58% to 60% on a year-on-year basis with improvement in industry market share from 8.4% to 8.6%.Continuing with our strategy of making big brands bigger, our leading inhaler brand, Foracort, clocked 27% growth in quarter one , which is one of the fastest -in top 10 IPM brands. Ibugesic Plus became the 11th brand to enter the top 100 IPM brands. Cipla is now among top two in terms of number of brands in the top 100 in the Indian pharma market. Our trade generics business maintains its market leadership supported by traction in big brands. We continue with our launch momentum by adding 23 products in the portfolio to build our future. Our consumer health arm, CHL, witnessed a strong double-digit growth with margins reaching closer to mid-teens for the quarter, leveraging on our brand strength, market penetration, attractive consumer-focused packaging, and positioning. Our differentiated portfolio in US continues to deliver strong growth for the franchise. The business yet again achieved its highest sales in the quarter by realizing a revenue of USD222 million, growing by a strong 43% over the last year. Generic Revlimid continues to perform as per expectations, while Lanreotide has improved its market share to 18% as per the MAT May 23. Market share of Albuterol, which witnessed a drop in quarter four of FY 23 has now stabilized. We have not lost any customer awards on the product and continue to execute multiple work streams to capitalize on any new opportunities to grow this share further. In South Africa, we are pleased to share that, Cipla is now the second largest player in the prescription market by market share. Cipla grew at a four-year CAGR of 8.6% in the market, which is growing at 3.6% per the IQVIA MAT May 23. South Africas private market grew 13% year-on-year powered by an uptick in focused therapies in our prescription business as well as the high growth of 16% in our OTC portfolio. Strong momentum across new launches has given our portfolio a new muscle for growth. Our focus continues to be driving market-leading growth and we aim to inch towards the top position in the market in the next few years. Investing in the future pipeline has always been our priority. We have three differentiated products undergoing clinical trials with filings targeted in FY 24 and 25. We are expecting Symbicort to be filed by the end of this year. On peptides, we expect 4 to 5 peptide launches in the next two years. We also expect a couple of new peptides to be filed in the same period. On the regulatory front, we still await classification from the US FDA for our Indore facility, which was audited in February 2023. However, we have already initiated corrective actions for observations as per the Form 483, we received from the FDA. Implementation of CAPA and remediation continues for our Goa facility, where we hope to be re-inspected in the second half of this financial year. As informed in our last earnings call, de- Cipla Limited July 26, 2023 risking has been progressing as per our expectations for our key assets. Generic Advair is being derisked to an in-house facility, while we wait for the Indore classification. As guided earlier, we are expecting to take this product to the market in a period of 12 months with no incremental generic competition expected in that time frame. Generic Abraxane, which is Nano-Paclitaxel, is being derisked to a CMO site. We expect the ability to supply from both of our sites for this file by FY 25. I would now like to invite Ashish to present the financial and operational performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Umang. This quarter we further enhanced our performance across all our core businesses with expansion and profitability. We witnessed growth in all three of our biggest markets of India, US, and South Africa, supported by growth in focus portfolio of chronic and differentiated products. Now coming to the key highlights for the quarter. We are pleased to report a quarterly revenue of INR6,329 crores. The overall revenue growth for the quarter was at 18% on year-on-year basis. Our One-India franchise further expanded its market share by growing at healthy 12%, supported by growth in chronic portfolio. The impact of NLEM pricing for the quarter has been largely offset by multiple measures. New launches contributed to the growth in branded prescription business with our in-licensed products, Galvus and Scapho, contributing to the list. The US business reported the highest ever revenue, driven by traction in differentiated portfolio with revenue of USD222 million, growing at 43% Y-o-Y. South Africa grew at 13% Y-o-Y in local currency terms, powered by a solid performance in private market, including OTC. Amidst geopolitical and currency headwinds, the focus of international markets has been on margin expansion, which has aided our quarter one performance. Our free cash flow generation and operating efficiency continues to drive our healthy net cash position. Our EBITDA margin stood at 23.6% for the quarter on a reported basis. As always, this EBITDA margin is not including other income. Our EBITDA margins for the quarter include impact of higher R&D expenses and other provisions. R&D investments are driven by ongoing clinical trials on differentiated portfolio as well as other developmental efforts higher in the quarter by 27% versus last year. Our reported gross margin after material costs stood at 64.7% for the quarter, which is 230 basis points above last years figures, driven by contribution from new launches and overall mix change. Total expense for the quarter included employee cost and other expenses, which stood at INR2,598 crores, up by 3.8% on a sequential basis. Total R&D investments for the quarter are at INR349 crores or 5.5% of revenue and what like I said, 27% higher on a Y-o-Y basis. Cipla Limited July 26, 2023 Profit after tax for the quarter is at INR996 crores, so close to about INR1,000 crores, and about 15.7% of sales. The effective tax rate is constant Y-o-Y at 27.5%. As of 30, June 2023, our debt primarily constitutes ZAR720 million in South Africa, with cash equivalent balance at a company level of INR6,941 crores. This results in improvement of our cash position from INR5,469 crores in March to INR6,138 crores in this quarter end. Looking ahead, we continue to walk on the path of revenue growth and operating profitability. Growth levers in the subsequent quarters will include continued market beating growth across One-India businesses of prescription, trade generics and consumer health. Traction, a robust traction in our North America franchise across complex portfolio and continued contribution from respiratory and peptide products, creating a more resilient business through de-risked portfolio and supply. Sustaining performance of quarter one for South Africa with focus on private market, select tender and improving the margins in South Africa, drive growth in focused geographies in international markets. We expect the full year EBITDA to be trending towards 23% for the year. Id like to thank you for your attention, and we request moderator to open for the questions.",

So thats one aspect. Second aspect, 60% of our country and more lives in Tier 2 to 6 cities. They are becoming more accessible. They want more access to health care, and they have the ability to pay for it. Thats one switch, where the trade generics begins to capture the market.

So we dont think theres a REITs that -- its trade generics versus branded generics versus consumer health care. These are all parts of the same market.

If you want to capture that opportunity -- organic has its own limitation. So therefore, we can constantly evaluate inorganic opportunities in India, which actually pays off well and it is within our expectation of hurdle rate. So India, we will continue to look at opportunities. And then even in South Africa, which is our core market, we want to grow to number 1 position. And of course, within the hurdle rate that we follow, the cost of capital for the country. So I think the focus will be to do acquisitions -- small acquisitions though in South Africa. In US as well, wherever there are white space, wherever we find some interesting products in our core strength, which is respiratory and of the other portfolio as well, we would look at opportunities there as well. So inorganic will play a big role in fund deployment within the cost of capital. Other than that, there is capex, there is increased R&D, and of course, well discuss, as we constantly discuss at the Board level on how to best utilize the capital.

Its -- even though we may think that the percentage increase because the US and India do better, they are larger businesses. But frankly, if South Africa does better, our margin profile improves dramatically because the South Africa business gets a tremendous leverage from top line growth. So its all our businesses that raises our confidence profile of our EBITDA trajectory. Now on consumer business, we have a large category in oral rehydrating solution, the ORS. And this time, this summer, unfortunately, only peaked sometime in the north in some part of June because the rains came earlier and there were rains throughout the summer. So actually, we have seen a slightly more muted quarter than we had expected in our consumer healthcare business. Having said that, quarter 1, quarter 2 are always the largest in this business. So weve not had a full season this time, the way we would have liked to see it in the consumer business. But despite that, it has shown the type of growth it has.",

Ladies and gentlemen wherever you are in India or in the rest of the world, welcome to the 87th Annual General Meeting of Cipla. In the past three years, major advancement in medical science provided solutions to protecting the well-being and health of society, including COVID-19 patients. Every time the world has faced a crisis, we have witnessed humanity coming out stronger. The advancement in pharma research, scientific innovation, newer discoveries of therapies and treatment options would not have been possible without the work, dedication and insight of scientists and researchers worldwide. Society in general owes them a deep debt of gratitude. All of you have received a copy of Cipla’s annual report for the year ended 31st March 2023. This includes a detailed summary of our financial performance, management discussions and analysis, business strategy, manufacturing operations, supply chain management, human relations, corporate social responsibility, environment practices and overall company governance. With your permission, I take the report as read. This is the sixth consecutive year in which we have presented a fully integrated annual report. It is pertinent to note that in the last two decades, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has stood true to its position of being the pharmacy capital of the world. Armed with a robust network of 3,000 pharma companies and approximately 10,000 manufacturing units spread across India. India offers a unique international competitive advantage. It is time that we re-evaluate Indias role within the global pharmaceutical industry, strengthen our position in the light of geopolitical changes, biodiversity, and attaining self-sufficiency with innovation as a guiding principle for future growth. Gentlemen, today the world is faced with many challenges including that of AMR, Anti-Microbial Resistance, climate change, natural disasters and multiple risks. Your company is actively working to combat AMR and improving antibiotic usage or misuse of antibiotics. We are also promoting incremental innovation in the area of repurposing and repositioning of active and essential drugs. On the environmental front, Cipla is making a major impact towards carbon and water neutrality and net zero targets to bring about a positive change in the world. During the year under review, we forged many partnerships and made significant investments in newer therapies such as messenger RNA, CAR-T cell therapies, biosimilars, stem cell research, digital therapeutics, etcetera. I sincerely believe that this will lead to build up the Cipla of the future. We maintain our rank as the third largest pharma company in India, and also in South Africa. We have recently achieved the second rank in that country. Apart from this, we are among the leading 15 global generic pharma companies. In the area of dispensing medicines in the USA, Cipla ranks among the top 10. In the field of respiratory medicine, our presence is growing with very new, interesting launches. We have a leading presence in the care spectrum with a wide range of drugs and device combinations that has established Cipla as a leader in respiratory medicine both in India and in many key emerging markets. Your company has extended its humanitarian approach beyond providing essential medicines. Cipla Palliative Care and Training Center has provided care beyond cure to many terminally ill patients, particularly suffering from cancer and allied ailments. Over the past 25 years, this center, which is in Pune, has cared for approximately 25,000 patients, along with their families and caretakers. This outstanding gesture on the part of Cipla gives all of us a great deal of satisfaction and has firmed up our resolve to expand access to Palliative care across the country. Guided by our compassion and perseverance, we will always strive to improve access to quality medicines and that too at affordable prices, not only in India and Africa, but globally as well. Finally, Id like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all my colleagues on the Cipla Board of Directors. And Ciplas management team for their support, guidance, and visionary leadership. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution to the company of all our employees, both past and present, as well as to our shareholders. So that Cipla can continue its successful march forward. As always, our profuse thanks to the medical profession, our customers, our suppliers, our partners, and associates for their continued support and trust in our company, the Evergreen Cipla. Thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you very much Chairman Sir, and welcome ladies and gentlemen and thank you for the opportunity to present the Cipla performance over the past one year. As most of you may have received the annual report, this time, the theme is Force for Good, and we just replicated that on this slide. So, if you go to the next slide, please. This is the snapshot of the performance. I think there are a couple of factors that we should be happy about. The first is the growth excluding COVID. Cipla showed an 11% percent growth year-on-year on a high base from the previous year of COVID therapies. The EBITDA margin is at - adjusted margin is at 23%. We reported closer to 22%. R&D spends have grown 20% year-on-year and are measuring in at about 6% of sales. So if you look at the overall snapshot, the strong trajectory and profitability continues. There is revenue growth, and as you may have seen in quarter one, numbers are revenue engine and momentum and the portfolio and pipeline that we have been investing over the past couple of years, is beginning to yield us, the outcomes that we had expected. Covering very quickly on our markets, One India was up 13% year-on-year. And again, this excludes the benefit of COVID. But if you were to look at just the trajectory of this business, over the past, I would say, eight quarters to 10 quarters has been consistently beating market. We are improving the share of chronic therapies in our portfolio, and our consumer franchise and generics business are contributing significantly to the various demographic patterns that we see in the India market. In North America, business has grown really strongly. Were at 23% growth. This business used to be sub 200, 300 million till about seven years to eight years back. And we continue to see the trajectory going forward, largely out of the portfolio unlocking that we have been bringing, our supply reliability, as well as the smart consumer strategy that we have deployed through the team in the US. On South Africa, the private market took a slight blip this year. I think it was adjusting for the COVID base in the numbers. Our business continues to remain strong. For many quarters now, almost 20 plus quarters, we have beaten market. And we continue to do so in terms of growth. This business is rebounding very heavily as we have seen in the quarter one of this year. And in international markets, the business withstood a lot of volatility, but we are in our direct to market businesses, which are the businesses, we are building for the future. Weve seen double-digit secondary growth almost across all the markets that we operate in. So the commercial engine of this company, I think, is firing very strongly. And I will cover the rest of the slides, where we will also talk about the operating performance. Can we go to the next slide, please? Beyond what we do commercially, we stand as a company that cares for life. There are several themes that the Chairman also mentioned in terms of Palliative care, but there is a lot that our foundation does in terms of disaster response, in terms of projects that we take on for sustainability, for health. And many people have told us that we as a company operate with the heart of a foundation and not that. And that is the most -- thats the best thing that we hear every time that we interact with significant shareholders such as the doctors, such as the hospitals, and several other stakeholders of our company. But a lot of work done by not only the Cipla Foundation, which has proudly led us to where we are today, but also the several aspects of our business. Can we go to the next slide, please? We had spoken to you about some of our strategy, which we had called the, the trinity of passion, capability, and economic engine. Id like to tell you that, we have achieved significantly almost all big aspects of our strategic blueprint. In fact, in this year, just about two to three weeks back, Cipla also had a discussion with the Board of the new strategy for the next four years. And there are equally challenging themes that have been laid out by the Board to the management. And the management has accepted that we will drive the strategy of Cipla around those pillars that have been articulated. But very quickly, over the past three years, not only has Cipla increased its portfolio in the lung leadership space, we disclosed that lung leadership and ailments of the lung account for 30% now of the share of our revenues. We spoke about wellness becoming very strong. Its currently about closer to 9% of our revenues. Were hoping to take that up to 15%. In AMR, we have created significant portfolio additions. And you know, every time there is a crisis, we want to be the company that can come up with a solution to problems that the world faces, just like we did in COVID, just like we did in HIV. As I mentioned, the home markets, most of the market commentary that I covered are in good standing at this point in time, as is the US, with the type of differentiated assets that we have. Of course, weve had some issues with our facilities, and I will talk about them in a separate slide. If you look at our emerging market strategy, that is in terms of double-digit growth that were seeing in most secondary markets. Thats on track. During the year and several years before, maybe two years to three years before, digital became a real opportunity for us to increase the canvas that we operate in. And the company has adopted several significant moves. Even the training that we impart today to patients goes through a digital universe that we call Breathefree, digital educators. And on the rest of the continuous improvement in our ability to create a benchmark of costs. That continues to happen. None of these is possible without three things that run in the organization. The first is the culture of quality. Second is the type of portfolio work that happens in our facilities, in our labs, because they are the real fuel for the fire that we put into each one of our commercial engines. And the third is the talent that this company has. And on all three, we have achieved significant breakthroughs. We continue to redefine the boundaries of science. Were continuing to push the envelope in drug product categories, work with agencies to get the best medicines that can satisfy unmet needs. In most places, we are a follow-on as a genetic, in the sense that we are the first genetic to the market. But in many places, we are now redefining this boundary to be the first company to be able to come up with this through our efforts in mRNA, through our efforts in bio, in the bio side of the world, and the Stempeutics, through our alliance partner in Stempeutics. And so theres a lot happening. I will cover quality as well, but we are very proud of what weve been able to achieve in the past strategic plan period that weve just finished. Can we go to the next slide, please? ESG continues to be a very strong focus for Cipla. We realize that as a company, we carry this responsibility. And Id like to repeat a line that our facility in Kurkumbh has. And that line inspires us every time and that line really is that you do not -- you dont inherit this earth from our parents, we borrow it from our children and thats the responsibility that we take as people at Cipla. We realize that, weve borrowed this planet from the future generations from our children and we need to leave it better than how we borrowed it. And that is a responsibility, as you can see, Chairman has outlined the goals that we are trying to achieve. We are well underway with these goals. The company is being recognized for what its doing in terms of carbon neutrality. I think about 40%, 45% of our power today comes from renewable sources. And thats a very strong achievement for us as a company. Were doing a lot in water because in pharmaceuticals it is very extensive with the use of water because we clean. And sometimes the water we use can be redeployed. And I think thats what we are trying to do. At the same time, were working with several communities around our facilities in making sure that they have sustainability embedded in those communities and how we can help them to achieve their objectives of life and sustainability. Could we go to the next slide, please. I want to speak about certain recent news items around the Goa and Indore facilities. I would like to give you a commitment that management is working earnestly to the remediation of what has been found by the US FDA at these facilities. In Goa, which the facility is from 2020, has been under the warning letter status from the FDA. We have some early, while we have remediated all the actions that we had promised to the FDA, we also have some early green shoots of progress. We were recently audited by the MHRA, and that audit went off relatively well. The while Goa waits for the opportunity to be re-inspected by the FDA. We have actively been de-risking our product portfolio from here and are working on moving some of these difficult to do products to other partner sites within our network where possible and with other partners where its not possible in our network. And Indore, which is a recent inspection, we have a constant dialogue with the FDA. We are in the process of remediating most of the actions that the FDA has mentioned. We believe a re-inspection of this facility may happen in the next year. And at this point in time, we have deployed the best consultants to help us with both of these facilities. So we feel confident that, we are on the right track and pretty soon, we are hoping that, these facilities complete the remediation activities that is demanded of them. Again here, the assets that we have filed which are limited are being delivered to our other sites, some of which happen to be in the US. Can we go to the next slide, please? So Chairman spoke about how this world is changing, about how science and how much of gratitude we as a society owe to the scientists. But some of those areas that are happening in the future, if you fast forward to the future, you would see biosimilars becoming a very large portion of our portfolio. You would see mRNA therapies becoming the cornerstone of how innovation comes. Genomics, the basic way in which respiratory medicine is changing and the impact of digital. And Id like to mention that we are cognizant of these. We are investing significantly either through ourselves or through our partner network, either through equity or through broad alliances into each of these areas. And several of these have been part of what the company has done over the past. But, and thats the focus that we bring, not just managing the today of operations, but making sure that, we continue to stay more relevant as a company than we have been today to the patients that we serve. Id like to thank the Cipla team. Id like to thank the Board for their counsel, their partnership, and the Cipla team for what we do every day, the 25,000 of us. Clearly, a lot of our initiatives are being recognized. Weve been awarded various awards, as well as several citations on what we do on a day-to-day basis. So with that, thanks to all of you shareholders for your support and to the employees of Cipla, our partners, and to the Board for their constant counsel and judgment. Thank you very much. Rajendra, Ill now transfer this to you.",

The shareholders may note that since this meeting is being held through video conference and the resolutions provided in the notice have already been put to vote through e-voting, there will be no proposing and seconding for the resolutions.

Item #1 and 2 of the notice have been proposed as ordinary resolutions for the adoption of audited, standalone and consolidated financial statement of the company for the financial year ended 31st March, 2023 and the report of the Board of Directors and auditor thereon.

The Board has recommended a final dividend of INR 8.50 per equity share for the financial year ended 31st March, 2023. Upon approval by the Shareholders, the Company will endeavour to pay the dividend within seven working days from the date of declaration, but in no case, it will be after 30 days from the Annual General Meeting. Item #4 of the notice has been proposed as an ordinary resolution for the appointment of Mr. Umang Vohra as a Director liable to retire by rotation. Except Mr. Umang Vohra, none of the Directors and key managerial personnel of the company and their relatives are concerned or interested in the resolution. Based on the performance evaluation and on the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee, the Board has recommended the reappointment of Mr. Umang Vohra as a Director liable to retire by rotation. Item #5 of the notice has been proposed as an ordinary resolution for ratification of the remuneration of cost auditor for the financial year 2023-24. The Board on the recommendation of the audit committee has approved the remuneration of INR 12,50,000 plus applicable taxes and out-of-pocket expenses as remuneration to Mr. D. H. Zaveri, the cost auditor. As per the provisions of the Companies Act, since the remuneration approved by the Board is required to be ratified by the members of the company, the Board recommends ratification of the remuneration of the cost auditor. We will now invite the members who have registered themselves to ask any question to the management, the statutory auditor or secretarial auditor or to make any suggestions. We have received 24 requests from the members who want to speak at the AGM. They will be unmuted and will be allowed to ask questions when called upon by the moderators. We will reply to all the questions and queries in one go. Considering the high registrations from the speakers in the interest of time, I request the members to keep their questions and comments in brief and not to repeat the questions which have already been asked by the fellow members. I also request to not to take more than 2 minutes. This will ensure that other members get opportunity to ask the questions. May I now request the moderator to please invite the shareholders one by one. Over to you moderator.",

      "content": "Good afternoon everyone. I am honored to have the opportunity to address you all today and would like to express my gratitude to the Board of Directors for allowing me this chance once again. First of all, I salute the Board of Directors for continuing VC mode of meeting thereby allowing pan India participation. So I request you to continue this trend. I am a satisfied shareholder of our company and I must commend the management for their remarkable efforts in creating wealth for the shareholders. However, I would like to raise a couple of concerns. My primary concern pertains to the utilization of savings on account of virtual mode of meeting. I believe it would be prudent and fair to allocate a portion of these funds to the welfare of the shareholders, more particularly among speaker shareholders, who actually participate in AGM as speakers. Considering the valuable contribution and active involvement in the meeting, it would be a gesture of recognition and appreciation to distribute a small memento among important festivals. Sir, can you provide me the expenses on account of virtual mode of meeting and on account of physical mode of meeting if possible? I humbly request to you all the Board to consider my proposal and explore the possibility of implementing this gesture of gratitude and appreciation. By doing so, I firmly believe that it will reinforce the positive rapport between the company and the stakeholders and contribute to the overall well-being of the corporate family. So my next concern is, Sir do you manufacture any drugs in preventing skin rashes or urinary infection and also do you manufacture any oncology products? So if yes, can you just share the name? My final concern is, the company has been hesitant in supporting individual in need, including myself. I have shared my credentials in the past and follow up consistently, but my request has not been considered. So not even differently able person be part of CSR activity then why the company is resistant in supporting me. I have appealed for your support in certification work including form 15 CB. Your assistance would mean a lot to me if I cant get help from such a reputable company like Cipla, then whom can I turn to. I am resending my credential after AGM to your id and hopes of receiving justice and proactive consideration for desired help and support. I want to clarify that I am not seeking handouts or free money nor sympathy. I value my independence and self-reliance as a charter accountant and I hope you can understand and respect my desire to maintain that independence. Thank you for considering my request. I firmly believe that, with your support, I can make significant contributions to our organization. Thank you so much.",

K..Hamied sir, Mr. M. K. Hamied, other eminent Directors on the Board, the Managing Director Mr. Umang Vohra, our CFO Ashish Adukia and our most favorite Mr. Rajendra Chopraji. Siddharth, Im very much thankful to you. Very, very efficient work you have done in the CS department, Secretary Department. Very helpful and very up to date in giving help to the shareholders. Very nice work done Siddharth. He should be rewarded. Even Im thankful to Natraj. He has also been very helpful and the whole team is very good. Thank you Mr. Rajendra Chopraji. Mr. Umang Vohra, I strongly support the resolution number four for his re-coming on the Board as the MD. Umang Vohraji, you have 0.04% of shares of Cipla. Very nice. I am very happy to note that, the Directors of the company are holding shares of the same company because in some companies Directors are there, who dont hold shares. This is, Im really very proud of you Mr. Umang Vohra and you have been doing very good job for the company. Thank you very much. Cipla has been the third largest pharmaceutical company, the 15th in the global generic company and third largest in the respiratory section. They say the revenue growth is almost 13%. Its very nice to note that. Commercial engineering of the company is operating perfectly well, no doubt. Sir, I would like to know, what is the total debt of the company and how, what is that and no doubt that it is coming down. At present, what is the total debt? I congratulate the company and all its employees for the hard work that they have done for receiving various awards and accolades. Specially, Cipla was first to introduce anti-retroviral drugs against HIV. Congratulate each and every employee and good luck to you for this. It is true that, success does not make the company great, but it is the contribution of each member of the company to the society at large that makes the company great and no doubt Cipla is doing that. All the best to you Cipla and its employees and the Board of Directors and the management team. Anyway, Cipla, Sir here as one of the shareholders has previously spoken about Titan. Titan has taken the great initiative in recalling, unclaimed dividend of the shareholders. Those who have not claimed dividend for the last seven years, so the dividend along with the certificate goes to the Investor Education, that is IEPF, Investor Education Protection Fund. And from there to trace out that past dividend is very difficult. So extra care has been taken by Titan and they have come out with the resolution that they are appointing a company and paying that company to retrieve the shareholders at their residence. At their residence, whether the residence is changed, whether the shareholder is dead or alive. Its a very good initiative by the company. I hope even Cipla comes up with such new, new helping aids to the shareholders instead of throwing the dividends to the IEPS fund. Next, I would like to. So, Im a bit little orthodox. I dont say that Im not modern, of course, Im modern also, but our Mother Earth is full of various plants, there are various, richly rewarding mother earth, especially of our country, India. And as likely said by Mr. Vohra, that we dont inherit, we not only inherit, I would say, we not only inherit from our parents, but we also borrow it from our children. And if when we say we borrow it from our children, we should do something for the Mother Earth also and for our future children also. We should do something for the mother earth also and our future children also. Like we have many medical herbs, many, many plants, which we can some way, we can use in, Cipla instead of just using only medical. There are lot of medicine made by muslim people from plants and herbs. Why dont we make use of all such plants and herbs of Mother Earth? Turmeric, ginger, fenugreek, all these are very very vital. We can come out with a turmeric milk powder, ginger milk powder. You know early morning to have a very hot cup of milk with a little ginger and turmeric is very good, especially in winter and in this monsoon season. Why we are not giving this to our public at large. Mr. Vohra, please and the medical team, please, I would like to request you to please put some special attention to this. And Mr. Ashish Adukia, you are a CFO, please see that some finances are given to them to take out such medicines from the plants and herbs. Also, one important thing I would like to make sure...",

I thank you, the management and its team, for giving 425% dividend. It is a very good dividend. I thank them for this. I also thank the employees, who work in our factory. Because of their hard work, we got such a good result today. And you gave us such a good dividend. I thank them and pray for you. If you work hard like this, we will also get a dividend. And the management will also get a good reward and get famous. Sir, this year, what new products have you launched? How many have you launched? What have you done in medicine? And what is your plan for growth in the future? Please tell us about this. And a few days ago, there was news in the paper and TV that our major promoter are going to sell their stake to some other foreign company. So India is such a big supplier of medicines. The American people are watching. What is the reason? Is this news true or false? If this is the case, then what is our management, our emergency management doing to save us? People have asked a lot of questions. But I dont remember. One is the dispute case. Three pages are filled with dispute cases. But we have a lot of disputes. So, you should talk about your legal case. Secondly, about the physical share, H S Patel was saying, Sir, I want to ask that our employees, how many employees are there, who have kept the physical share? Why dont they get the demat of the employees, who are still in the physical sale? While the SEBI has been continuously asking since 2018 to get them demated. And as far as our shareholders are concerned, you have kept the shares on physical sale, we dont have any problem. The thing is that, the names that have been kept are not even alive. So, it will definitely be a problem for that. Earlier, we used to keep 2-3 pan cards. Now, one pan card is over. I wont take much time, sir. What steps have you taken about renewable energy? And what steps have you taken for recycling water? Lastly, I would say that VC meeting is very good. People can attend from outside. So, I would like to do a physical meeting in the future. So, keep the option of 10-15 minutes for VC meeting in the future. Which we outside shareholders, your employees and your employees, present outside can thanks for the same. Lastly, Sir, I wish you all a happy 2023. And I pray to God, for your health and your family, I wish you a happy 2023 with healthy, prosperous and safe. I wish you all a happy 15th August. I thank the moderator. I thank his management. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat. Thank you very much for giving time.",

And what I see, it is a six years revenue and package increasing, page number 10, all your highlights are excellent and what is basically that, you are your presence and your turnover because now all MNCs turnover is not that much and our turnover is 23,000 crores and really we are helping people to have medicines. And what is my observation? I have gone through the standalone profit and loss and consolidated profit and loss. My observation is that our consolidated report is excellent this time and the loan is slightly lower than the previous year. And my other observation is in standalone, the employment cost is INR 2,377 crores and my PAT is INR 2,513 crores. So, PAT is higher than the employment in standalone. But when I look into the consolidated, my PAT is INR 2,832 and the employment cost is INR 3,830 crores, which is much higher by around INR 1,000 crores. And what I feel that when we run a company, we run a company for shareholders, promoters and to make profit. And here what I see, we spend more money on employment. So definitely, I feel personally that we should look into this aspect and then see that our PAT is always higher than running cost. Another thing, the first speaker talked about the share. I have seen, last four months, I should say in 2019, I was doing demat and after that I stopped it and now from 15th of March I started demating my shares and around at least I have done 60 companies dematting. But what I have found with k-fintech is there is no consistency, there is no logic and there is no common sense while doing a demat procedure because if the share value is very low still they will take and if because of this, I am facing some problem with six companies and that companys details. I have provided in the pdf form to you and if you can help me in that respect in this case if you take our company secretary Rajendra Chopra can do that and ask him to see that, the demand is reached and today I went to the bank what is my observation sir this basically case will take long time they take lot of time or they dont do the demating. But all small RPAs in India, they do the demating very fast, very quickly, without any hassle. So, and if I can do the demat of 60-70 shares, why the K-Fintech is taking time to demat my six company shares and another thing, what I observed that, I have done KYC with K-Fintech for my wife and myself in Reliance 560 shares. So, it is already available with them and another thing in case of rain industry, K-fintech works are there but company says dont care what K-fintech says only provide me.",

This is a good sign that your sales team finance team and Chairman are showing their hard work. Our revenue is INR 15,790 crores. You can see a lot of hard work. If we see in that also, our revenue, net profit is INR 2,513 crores. This is also a very good thing. According to your observation, our share revenue has increased well. So our INR 2 share, behind that and the earning is INR 30.61 This is very good. You are showing a great manner. This is good for next year. The first quarter result you have given today is also very good. On June ‘23, we saw our revenue on the BSE side. INR 4,318 crores. This is an exponent, but our net profit is INR 895 crores for a single quarter. This is a very good effort of yours. You are doing a good job. I just want to know from you how much is our global investment and how much is our revenue of the global international market. And lastly, I have a request. You can make our share of INR 2 into INR 1. We are not asking for a bonus. But we request you that, if you share INR 1 rupee, then we will have 2 shares of INR 1. Meaning, the bonus will be like this only. And there will be no reflection in our finance or balance sheet. Only the number of shares will increase. The number of shares will increase. And I say that if you do 2 shares, then next year our INR 1 share will be traded at INR 1200- INR 1000. So if possible, sir, please accept our request and pass it in your Board meeting. And make 2 shares of INR 1. I support you in every resolution. Your secretary department is also doing a great job. We have the same feeling as you do, that the shareholders should get as much support as possible. We have the same feeling as you do, that the shareholders. We feel very good.

This is the first time I am attending your AGM with the help of and cooperation of your AGM team, thanks to them. As per report page 58, intellectual capital, have you found out any devices for overall insulin? Page number 60, you have said that, the company has launched new products 81, 93 and 78 year-on-year, but why 15 products short in ’22- 23, what is the reason. Pg number 69, in expansion for the name Cipla, you have given performance with accountability for letter P. Is it possible to implement in the present situation? Fixing accountability is very difficult. Is there any precedence for that? Page number 83, asthma patients are coming out more from city areas. Any new effective devices, tablets or capsules are found out for these patients. Nowadays it has become a talk of the town that using inhalers are dangerous, what is your comment? Page number 84, have you said in maximizing, you have said in the maximizing shareholders value that engage with investors through meeting and conference, why you did not conduct physical meeting? Page number 121, after declaring dividend, the companys duty is to see reserves. Good reserves speaks about the stability of the company. Here, transfer to reserves maintains silence. What is the reason? So, page number 185, company has given due dates for transfer of unclaimed dividend, but the amount is not mentioned, why? What is the reason? Page number 290, balance sheet, companys property plans decreased by INR 255 crores, but depreciation expenses increased by INR 130 crores, what is the reason? Investment increased by INR 825 crores, whether the company feels investment is more beneficial than putting the funds in companys activity. In trade receivables, a total INR 66 crores are at the verge of becoming bad, it is not a small amount, it would be a big hit to the profit growth, how do the company attempt to realize it? Your equity capital is running on the same track and other equities that is retained, earnings going up, why cannot the company declare bonus shares to keep the capital in comfortable position to bring down the borrowings, liabilities and finance costs? Lastly, if the company attempts to control shrewdly the increase in other expenses, companys current year profit growth will be a sound one. Thank you very much sir, see you next year in the same part.",

Right from day one, from my daddy-mummys time, I am having Cipla along with us. So, Cipla is in every nook and cranny. And the work that Cipla has done and shown, sir, it has given so much reward to shareholders, it has earned so much, that is fine. But it has also given to the community as well. It has done such a good job in the community and society, for downtrodden, for the medicines, and in every way, we are in a win-win position, frankly speaking. For the shareholders, for the community and society, and for our own organization, and for employees, staff and officers, and for all of your management also, sir. You have improved a lot. The business acumen, the business understanding sir and the business that is in you, which is embedded in your nerves for this field, that is amazing in itself. And we really salute you sir for your mastery in this field. And sir, you all have a lot of, sir. Today in fact, how many meetings are there today, sir, and all of them are going to start at 3 oclock. Where do we have to come and how? When we are in a good company, we cant leave your company. Rajendra ji, many times, how many good secretaries you have met, sir. Natraj, Rajendraji has been a great partner to me. Natraj, Rajendra and all his partners are great. They have a great investor care service. They have a great coordination with the investors. They have a harmonious and cordial relationship. We have never seen a shareholder go to the secretary team, take their issue, their problem, their query and come back disappointed. They always satisfied us with very good hospitality. First of all, they make the shareholders comfortable. Please come and sit. What will you have? Drink water, have tea. They make him calm and then drink tea, make us calm down and then satisfy us. Really, these teams are very good. And your team, the technical team of Zoom, they are also very good. They helped us a lot in joining this meeting. Everywhere, sir, your name is heard, whether it is a foreign country or an Indian country. So many places, I have been to, almost 90% of the world, the medicines of Cipla are very effective. Sir, I would like to know, which new medicine has been launched this year, which is very effective and which medicine is waiting for this year, which is very popular and which medicine is waiting for our approval in the pipeline. I also want to know, which is the medicine is giving us maximum revenue and maximum profitability at national level and international level. And sir, what is the utilization of our plant capacity, we would like to know? And sir, for senior citizens, who have been associated with you for many years, you do CSR activities, it is very, very wonderful, we are very happy. But the shareholders, who have been associated for many years, who have become senior citizens, you should also do something for them. See, L&T has made a very good plan for senior citizens in Karjat. Anyone can come. So if ever there is a need and someone needs to come, then at least something should be done for this. Rest, sir, your work is great in itself. Whatever you have done for the community and society, If possible, please arrange for the factory visit very earliest. Please think about the bonus as it gets taxable and most of the shareholders are coming above 30% of the bracket. So, 1/3rd amount goes into taxation. So, you benefit the shareholders in this way in mini bonus. We will be very happy for factory visit. We are very proud of being shareholders with you from generation to generation, family to family. We wish you a long life, a safe and happy life, an enchanting healthy-wealthy life. And we pray to God. And we support all the appointments, reappointments of Directors. I have already voted in favour of all the resolutions as usual. And our support will remain for you in the lifetime, sir. Because we have got total confidence, trust and faith. Sir, wherever you are, there is no need to worry. You stay in complete peace of mind. Our investment is doing such a good job with you that, we cannot express it in words. So once again, I wish you all the best, sir, along with all the officers, employees, staff and all those, who are connected with us. And with all the good wishes for the upcoming festivals. May your future be a super hit. May you always be fit. I pray to God that you always be with us. And may we always get your blessings. Thank you very much for your patient listening. Jai Hind.",

      "content": "Thank you. Chairman, and Im happy to note your comments and thank you for the support from the Board as always and to each and every employee and partner of Cipla. So I will go quickly through the questions. Mr. Arun Boppana, you had asked about the Ukraine war. You had asked about some statistics on HR in terms of gender and average age. You asked about assets and asked about new drug delivery. I think the assets question can be answered by Ashish subsequently. Let me start by saying the Ukraine war had negligible impact in terms of material costs but it had a huge impact in terms of freight costs and it had a huge impact in terms of crude, etcetera. Those have been mitigated by the Company. In terms of HR statistics, were about 14.4% of our employees are women. This is about a percent higher than the last year. We are fortunate that we are able to grow this. It is our endeavor to make our workplaces more gender diverse. In terms of overall age, Cipla’s, only 3% of Cipla’s population, firstly, is over the age of 50 years. 39% to 40% is between the age of 30 to 50, and the balance are less than 30 years. So our average age comes up to about 33.7 years or 34 years or so. In terms of new drug delivery, there is tremendous work happening. You asked specifically about transdermal patches. We are continuing that program. Unfortunately, that lead product that we had from Japan, that is not progressing any further. But transdermal patches as a technology, we have several that we have launched in India as a platform that continues to go forward. Smita Shahji, Bharat Shahji, your question was on physical AGM. I think we have noted those comments. The last bonus issue of the company was in 2006 in a ratio of 3:2. Mr. Kaushik Shahukar had asked about the products for skin rashes and oncology. We have several products. In fact, we are launching now biosimilars in the area of skin rashes. We have a partnership with Novartis for Scapho, which is a psoriasis product. We also have several products that we have launched through our division. Rivela is our range that we sell, which is for skin moisturizing, skin rash. Several of our products are there. In oncology, we have several products.We sell almost 60% to 70% of the range that we can, that we have marked for ourselves. We have collaborations with Roche. We make our own products as well and many of them are sold. So, whether it is Trastuzumab, Devastuzumab, all of these are sold by Cipla in India. Ms. Patel, you had asked questions about the debt of the company. I think Mr. Adukia will answer that later. You also asked about herbal medicines and I am happy to report to you that Cipla is doing a lot in the area of herbal medicines. We are launching, you may have seen that even the product of ORS, we have re-launched that with some herbal flavors. Weve also got Nimbu Pani in it. Please do try it if you have not and there are several other herbal products that we are working on within a consumer health care division. Rajesh Chainaniji had asked about the EPS and the bonus. I think that will be clarified by Mr. Ashish Adukia. Mr. Bharat Negandhi, you had asked a question on over email that will be responded to you by the companys secretarial team. Santosh Sarafji, your question was on new products. You had also warned about dispute cases that they are increasing. So, I would like to tell you that, we track dispute cases very well. We track these cases very well and your observation is correct that these cases have increased a little. But our legal team is hoping to reduce it over a period of time. And you will see. As for new products, we launch 10 products in every market in America. In India, we launch 40 to 50 products. In emerging markets, we launch 90 products. And we have seen that it is increasing year by year. Bimal Agarwal, you asked for an online meeting only and we are considering that between the request for physical and online. Hariram Chaudhary, your question was on the CSR part. I think we do spend many years, we are slightly higher than 2% of the overall spend of the company. The Chairman of the committee is Mr. M. K. Hamied. The company is doing a lot in artificial intelligence. We have several ChatBots that are working. We have a supply chain function that is incubating artificial intelligence. Capex related questions will be taken on by Ashish Adukiaji. Dyaneshwar Bhagwat, your question was on growth for this year versus the next year. We do not give that guidance. I think you can take the quarter one numbers and overall the year in the growth will be healthy. Id like to also, you also asked about domestic share. We are roughly about 5.5% share in terms of prescriptions. We are trying to get closer to 6%. We are number three in the market in India. Anil Parekhji, you had asked for plans in other markets. We have a set of focus markets in the world. Obviously, India, South Africa, US are large markets within the emerging side of the world. The Indian subcontinent, closer markets like Sri Lanka, Nepal will continue to be strong going forward for us. We are also trying to build our presence in Brazil, trying to also build our presence in China. If you go to the next questions, Surekha and Sharadkumar Shah, youre asked about standalone to consolidated numbers in reference to employee costs. Ashish will take that further. It is the endeavor of the company to make sure that employee productivity stays high. The same time, every employee who works with Cipla must have a huge commitment to their career. And Cipla is trying to find that balance as a company. Were trying to do the best we can for employees. This is truly the force that propels our company going forward. Dinesh Bhatiaji, you had asked about shares pledge. We have noted your comments. Global investment figure, Ashishji will tell you, but you were looking at standalone numbers. We report on consolidated numbers. I hope you look at those numbers as well. I think Manoj Guptaji, your question has been answered by Chairman in terms of the stake rumors around the stake sale. Sadanand Sastry, you had asked about oral insulin. There is, we have inhaled insulin coming into India very soon. We are also working on oral products, peptide products that will act as insulin as well as act as waste reduction products over a period of time. So you will see this coming in the next two to three years. Jyoti, there were also several other questions you had asked, right? They were about, what are we doing to make sure that inhalers are not dangerous. I think we do several awareness campaigns. We call it Berok Jindagi. Inhalers are safe. They are efficacious. This message is going out to several people. You spoke about the depreciation investment. Ashish will cover some of those points when he will cover your answers. Jaydeepji your question was more on future capex. I would like to say we are going to spend approximately INR 800 crores, between INR 800 crores to INR 1,200 crores every year on capex. We are very judicious about what we spend. This is in line with how the industry standard is moving. R&D will continue to be a large focus for us. That was your second question. We will continue to do between 6% to 8% of sales on R&D and within that, we will prioritize the best outcome that we can get. Yusuf Rangwala and Fatima Rangwala, your question was on factory visit. We have taken that into account. Also on oncology, yes, we are doing a lot of medicines that we are coming out with an oncology. This is one of those areas that is a focus area for the country. Theres also been a lot of collaborations, we are trying to strike because this part of medicine has several, has lots of innovation that is best to be tapped in the market. Gautam Tiwariji, your question was about which medicines are new and which are being launched and which are being used more. Our inhaler franchise is running a lot. Oncology side is also running a lot. In diabetes, we have many new collaborations in India. That is also running a lot. Our capacity utilization is mostly between 75% to 75% plus in plants. Because of this, our capex program will run for INR 1,000 crores to INR 1,200 crores every year. So, with that, I have come to the end of the list. Maybe Ashish, if you can quickly cover some of the questions on the financials that the shareholders had asked.",

      "content": "Yes. Thank you, Umang. So, Mr. Arun Kumar, you had a question on attrition rate. So, that is about 20% for us. This is more or less in line with the industry. On asset-based, of course, we do not give the projection or forward-looking asset base, but currently our non-current asset is somewhere around 12,200 roughly, which includes your fixed asset as well as your other non-current assets. Mr. Kaushik, you had a question on virtual cost of AGM, its about somewhere around INR 50 lakhs and physical used to cost of about INR 1.2 crores to INR 1.5 crores roughly. So it is certainly saves us money. Hitokshij your question was around total debt. Our total debt is only about INR 532 crores, which includes the debt of QCIL also. Once QCIL is out, then it will be about INR 520 crores roughly. There was a question around global investment. Like Umang had said, the global investment, if you look at standalone, it is INR 9,138 crores, which includes the investments that we are making into your subsidiaries, but on a consolidated basis that number is squared off, so it is much smaller number. There was a question around the shareholding, so 33.47% is owned by promoters. All the other is public shareholding, which is institution as well as retail shareholders. Transfer to reserve is not mandatory as per new companies act and that is why we have not done that. The unclaimed dividend is about INR 11 crores, which is mentioned in the annual report as well. CSR amount is about INR 62.3 crores, which is slightly over 2%. Capex is INR 841 crores. We stay in the zip code of about 4% to 5% of the revenue. There was a question around standalone profits that have come down in comparison to previous year, one of the key reasons for that is other income that has come down, which is the dividend from subsidiaries that has come down, which was special dividend last year from subsidiary to Cipla Limited. There was also a comparison made of employee cost versus the profit between standalone and consolidated. I would like to point out that most of our large manufacturing facilities and therefore a large portion of our employees sit in India, which is a standalone entity and therefore the employee cost in India and a standalone entity is much larger and consolidated of consolidates are overseas entities as well. Then there was a comment made on reduction in capex. Like I said the capex made is INR 841 crores, but there was these classification of certain assets as asset held for sale, which we have made the announcement for, which is QCIL. Due to that, the capex number and of course, because of depreciation, the numbers have come down. But we have made investment in capex, like I said. There was an increase in investment that is because of our investment in Ethris. There was a comment made on bad debt. You may please go and see page 340. In fact, weve had recovery of bad debt as well this year and theres a lot of regard that goes into following up on any receivable, which is overdue. Other expenses, there was a comment which has gone up because of traveling that has increased and professional fees also is included in that increase that is there. There was a comment on global revenue. Global revenue or overall exports in FY ‘23 was about 56.6%. And that broadly reflects our ex-India revenue as well. Yes, thats it from my side. On dividend, I would like to just comment that, we have increased the dividend payout from 16% to about 25% and we have also put up a revised policy of dividend on the website which talks about somewhere around 30% dividend is an endeavor that we will make depending on the cash requirements of the company for various medium term and long term requirements. Thank you.",

      "content": "Thank you, Ajinkya. Good evening to all of you. Thank you for joining us today for our Second Quarter Earnings Call for the year. In Q2 FY24, we have continued the trend of strong performance and we have recorded our highest ever quarterly revenue at Rs.6,678 crores with a year-on-year growth of 15% and an EBITDA margin of 26%. This was made possible through double-digit growth across our core markets of India, North America and South Africa. In our One India franchise, Im pleased to share that the franchise has yet again posted a healthy year-on-year growth of 10% despite a weaker anti-infective sale and a slower consumer growth for our CHL business. This growth was largely supported by continuing faster than market growth in branded prescription where we grew at 11% against the IPM growth of 10% as per IQVIA MAT. The share of chronic therapies in our portfolio has improved by 140 basis points year-on-year to 60%. Cipla Limited October 27, 2023 Trade generics consolidated its leadership position in the market despite the season which continued to be muted, Gx posted a strong year-on-year growth, supported by performance across realization, volume and a lower cost of goods. Our generics business has embarked on a journey of constant evolution through new product introductions, leveraging partnerships with our associate company GoApptiv and deepening our distribution network. Our priority has been to grow our big brands across all the branded prescription and the OTC businesses. In India, branded prescriptions, we have 22 brands with revenues over Rs.100 crore as per IQVIA MAT September 23. Our leading inhaler brand, Foracort, is one of the fastest growing amongst the top 10 IPM brands. Trade generics now has seven brands over Rs.50 crores in the trailing 12 months. Cipla Health derives its growth from five brands, which are flagship and well above Rs.100 crores in the trailing 12 months. In North America, in this quarter, we progressed further on strengthening the core by delivering quarterly revenue of $229 million, which represents a 28% growth over last year. Our key asset of Lanreotide has improved its market share to 20% as per IQVIA August 2023. There is generic Revlimid performed in line with Q1. We continue to execute multiple work streams in Albuterol where market share has improved by 90 basis points to 12.9% compared to Q1 of FY24. In our South Africa in Global Access business, we continue to outperform the market at a significant pace. We registered a solid 12% year-on-year expansion in top line led by South Africa private market where the secondary market grew at 10% versus the market growth of 4%. Private market growth was achieved through an uptick in focused therapies in our prescription business, new launches as well as solid performance in the OTC portfolio. Our aim is to reach the top position in the prescription business. In our South Africa OTC business, brands of BRONCOL and CORYX continue to gain market share. BRONCOL has now captured close to 50% market share as per IQVIA MAT August 23. One of our most important focus areas in the past has been efficient capital allocation. Most recently, we announced the acquisition of Actor Pharma in South Africa. The market there is poised for growth in the OTC side and Actor has strong OTC brands which complement the existing offerings and have potential to grow bigger leveraging Ciplas existing marketing network. Cipla Limited October 27, 2023 We also divested our stake from Cipla QCIL in Uganda and Saba Investment Limited for our business in new DMF. While it has helped us in derisking our asset base, we will continue to service these markets via our B2B market. R&D investment has also been consistently increasing. In terms of pipeline for North America, we have made significant progress on clinical trials across some of our complex pipeline. We have three complex products undergoing clinical trials, with filings targeted in FY24 and 25. Generic Symbicort being one of them, where we have successfully completed our clinical studies. Filing for this asset is planned for Q3 of this year. In addition, were likely to file another generic inhalation asset shortly where hopefully we can aim to be among the top filers. On our peptide portfolio, we plan to launch one product in Q4 of FY24, while there are three, four launches planned in FY25. Derisking of generic Advair, a partnered inhalation asset and generic Abraxane has been progressing as per our expectation. On the compliance front, at Long Island, New York, all our units at InvaGen have recently completed their CGMP audits. While the Unit-3 inspection resulted into classification as VAI, the Unit-2 inspection has no observations by the US FDA. We received an OAI in our Indore facility, which was audited in February 2023. We have already initiated corrective measures for observations as performed 483 from the US FDA and have made satisfactory progress as on date. At Goa, the CAPA implementation and remediation exercise has completed. We will soon be submitting requisite data to enable the reinspection. I would now like to invite Ashish to present the financial and operational performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Umang, and good afternoon to all. Continuing with the strong Q1 performance, we progressed further with exceptional performance across core businesses with expansion and profitability. Coming to the key numbers for the quarter, we are pleased to report a quarterly revenue of Rs.6,678 crores, highest ever in Cipla history. The overall revenue growth for the quarter was at 15% YoY. Our ex QCIL sales stands at Rs.6,490 crores with YoY growth of 14% and EBITDA at Rs.1,690 crores or 26% of EBITDA. EBITDA margin stood at record 26% for the quarter on a reported basis. As always mentioned by me, this EBITDA margin does not include other income. Cipla Limited October 27, 2023 Calibrated price actions in core portfolio across branded and generic markets combined with easing input cost, continued freight decline and favorable forex have contributed to improved operating profitability. One India franchise further expanded its market share by growing at healthy 10% and exceptional performance in an acute-heavy quarter which was difficult for the industry due to inconsistent seasonality. This growth was supported by mix shifting to chronic portfolio, gross margin improvement and new launches. North America yet again reported the highest ever revenue driven by traction in the differentiated portfolio with revenue of $229 million growing at 28% YoY. South Africa grew by 9% YoY in local currency, powered by a solid performance in private market and OTC. Private market growth was supported by a strong secondary channel performance in oncology, CNS and CVS, as well as the hospital segments. OTC continue to focus on big brands as well as new launches. Our free cash flow generation and operating efficiency has helped us to drive healthy net cash position. R&D investments for the quarter are at Rs.379 crores or about 5.7% of revenue driven by ongoing clinical trials on differentiated asset as well as other developmental efforts higher in the quarter by 13% versus last year. Depreciation, impairment and amortization expense includes a partial impairment of a non- operational domestic manufacturing unit. And it also includes an impairment of an acquisition cost of an intangible in the form of product in the US. Both these totals up to impairment of about Rs.53 crores. Reported gross margin after materials cost stood at 65.4% for the quarter, which is 240 basis points above last years figures, driven by overall mix change, contribution from new launches as well as lower procurement cost on key APIs. Total expenses for the quarter include employee cost and other expenses which stood at Rs.2,631 crores, up by 1% on a sequential basis. Profit after tax for the quarter is at Rs.1,131 crores or at about 17% of sales. ETR is constant sequentially at 27.5%. As of 30th September 2023, debt primarily constitutes ZAR720 million in South Africa with cash equivalent balance of about Rs.6,811 crores overall post payment of dividend in this quarter. Key focus areas and growth levers in the subsequent quarters will include the focus area for One India would be to recoup the growth in the Wellness portfolio, while maintaining the market beating growth in Rx and Gx. Cipla Limited October 27, 2023 In North America, our focus would be to grow the core revenue, resolve the US FDA observations, maximize our partnered launches and also derisk assets in order to accelerate new launches. We will continue to derisk our key launches for FY25. Sustaining performance of Q2 for South Africa with focus on private markets and select tender business with focus on margin expansion. While margins in EMEU have been very strong, the focus of H2 would be to drive growth in top line there. So, we are increasing our guidance on EBITDA from 23% what we had given earlier to 23% to 24% with bias towards the higher end. Our ROI continues to be strong and in this quarter on an LTM basis comes up to about 27%. Id like to thank you for your attention and request the moderator to pick up the questions now.",

Now, if I were to exclude the acquisition that you did, it looks like the growth is around 7% and you mentioned trade generics growing in double-digits. Does it mean that the overall prescription and the consumer business is trending around 5% to 6%? And if thats the case, whats the reason for the slowdown and how do you see this moving forward in the second-half?",

If you take out the acquisition, which is what were doing, I think you have to take out from last year we had a certain tender position in one of the products we had won and thats basically replaced by the acquisition weve made. So, core business growth both on the Rx and Gx side is close to an over 11%. So, those businesses are growing stronger and much higher than market. I think on a consumer franchise, weve seen a fairly significant slowdown more because of the weather pattern. We sell a lot of the ORS product and I think weve not seen that level of sales of that product because of the weather pattern in Q2. And this result is fairly consistent with the category of beverage and with some of the other consumer products weve seen in this quarter. Having said that, I think this quarter we are looking at it bouncing back quite significantly. So, no, I think the branded growth and the generic growth is very strong in the previous quarter, its the consumer growth which had a little bit of an issue.",

So, its combination of these two things that led to improvement in gross margin and there is some bit of operating leverage that Cipla Limited October 27, 2023 exists due to which the increase in sales, your other expenses have got absorbed. And if you are comparing to just previous quarter, the previous quarter had some recall cost sitting out there of Albuterol that we had talked about, which of course is not sitting in this quarter.

I think theres a list that the FDA puts out quite routinely about shortages in the US. At least for those product families, we are not seeing price erosion. Thats why theres a balance, because theres a fair number of products that are on the shortage list for various reasons that there is an equal counterbalance to lesser price erosion. So yes, I think from a US portfolio also there has been some amount of margin expansion. The other thing is I think if you broadly look at our India business, as the ratio of chronic in our overall mix begins to increase, margins will go up in the business, because if you look at high chronic businesses in India, they operate at much higher margins than high acute business. So, as your chronic mix, the last two to three quarters, weve seen a chronic mix improving because our teams are focusing in building those therapies. I think the natural impact of this is also on some amount of margin expansion.",

I think as that begins to even out, we will probably see an expansion in volumes. See, we are sliding to a multiyear assumption of where India will grow somewhere around the 12-ish percentage range on a long-term five-year basis. We think a 12% CAGR for India is not uncommon. Actually, our numbers are quite close whether the volume is low or the price is moderated. So, if you really look at it, our YTD growth will be somewhere at least, in the branded prescription business also around 12% range. And this is happening despite volume growth being lower. There might be a year where volume growth is higher, but price growth may be lower. So overall, the 12% number will probably hold as a CAGR over the next couple of years.",

So South Africa even at 10%, they will still be at par or in terms of growth with them. So, therefore, the share of South Africa will remain same even if they become #1 for us. I think the constant focus in South Africa is also a margin for us and we want to get close to company average margin. Therefore, the growth out there will always be calibrated to make sure that the margin is not compromised and thats why youve seen over last many years the shift that has happened from tender business to private market and now looking at OTC as another lever of profitable growth out there. Actor Pharma that we have acquired, which comes with a portfolio, there is a huge synergy that sits out there to actually leverage our distribution network to push those products in. And the success that weve seen in CORYX and BRONCOL is likely to get replicated in Actor Pharma.

With the chronic mix going up, which has higher gross margin that leads to better EBITDA margin as well and there is some bit of operating leverage also that were seeing in India. Likewise, in US, certain products we have better volume albeit could be with some price erosion, but there are certain products where we have taken price actions as well. So, overall, these two geographies have driven the margin because they are a large portion of your business as well. At the same time, there are other businesses where like South Africa I talked about where the margin improvement is clearly visible between Q1 and Q2, and hopefully that trend will continue there for three and four as well.",

      "content": "If the certainty of launches in the US improves because of the remediation we are doing at our sites and the transfers, obviously, our confidence in the margin will increase as well. So, to answer your question, there are at least three of our businesses are running ahead of their internal estimates both on the top line and also on the bottom line; one is India, the second is the US and the third is South Africa. So, there is a margin beat on account of all three that we have seen. On our emerging markets business, even though we are running slightly lower than the internal estimates on top line, on bottom line we are running because of expenditure control almost to the same extent. So, that is the reason that I think the margin trajectory has improved. If you look at our costs overall, the cost basis is 11.5% over the previous year. Realistically, in our business, we never increased more than 11%, 12% of cost year-on-year. I think the real increment were getting is on the margin. Also, in the previous year we had a fair amount of remediation cost built in on account of our facilities which now is reducing because a lot of the remediation is already underway.",

      "content": "Thank you, Ajinkya, and good evening to all of you. I thank you for joining us today for earnings call for quarter 3 fiscal year 24. Let me address the issue of the results released at the outset. On Saturday, it came to our attention that there was a potential leak of parts of our standalone results on the social media. We took prompt action to inform the stock exchange and took a decision to advance our results in order to avoid investors trading on the basis of unapproved results. Were investigating the matter and would like to highlight that the leak was not attributable to internal employees or systems of Cipla. Coming to the results of this quarter, we continued our growth trajectory across the flagship businesses of India, North America and South Africa and improved our operating margins. So, this was our seasonally strong quarter across all our markets. I would like to cover themes which played out into our financial performance for this quarter. These themes include continuing market-leading growth in our core markets, focus on growing our large brands, investing in our future pipeline organically and inorganically, and regulatory resolution at our facilities. In-line with our theme on delivering growth across key markets, our One-India business posted a healthy growth of 12%, backed by traction across branded prescription, trade generics and our consumer health business. In our branded prescriptions business, we grew ahead of the market with our Chronic portfolio outpacing the market with a growth of 13% against the IPM growth of 11% as per IQVIA MAT December 23. Respiratory, cardiac and urology were key drivers of the growth for the quarter. Share of chronic therapies and portfolio has improved by 115 basis points year-on-year to 60.3%. Our trade generics business further consolidated its leadership position in the market by posting consistent year-on-year Cipla Limited January 25, 2024 growth. This performance was supported by execution of our order book, traction and new introductions and deepening distribution network and technology to improve reach. Business will further execute these work streams to expand their offerings and reach. Consumer health franchise posted year-on-year growth supported by traction in leading brands and stronger reported brand equity, albeit in a slower market. The operating profitability continues to be sustainable. In North America, we reported an all-time high quarterly revenue of $230 million, which represents an 18% growth over last year. This was the 15th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth for the business. Positive volume traction due to seasonality in our products and demand and base business, which is usual for this quarter every year, propelled this consistent growth. In Lanreotide, we have set a -- we now have a 20% market share. In SAGA, we completed our sale of QCIL during the quarter. Excluding QCIL, SAGA recorded 35% year-on-year growth in USD terms backed by growth in South Africa as well as Cipla Global Access. In our South Africa prescription business, our growth in secondary market was at a healthy 7% versus the market growth of 2% as per IQVIA MAT November 23. We are inching closer to the market leader. Our tender and OTC business has also witnessed positive traction during this period. In Cipla Global Access, our tender business for rest of Africa posted a year-on-year growth supported by execution of the order book. Our next theme is growing our big brands bigger. Big brands continue to be at the forefront of our India story. In branded prescription, we have 20 brands with revenues over INR100 crores as per IQVIA MAT December 23. Foracort, our leading inhaler brand, is now the biggest brand in IPM as per IQVIA Q3 FY 24, gaining 3 ranks year-on-year to reach the top spot. Cipla now has the highest number of brands in the IPM top 10, top 50 and the top 100 as per December 23 IQVIA report. Our trade generics business now has over -- has 8 brands over INR50 crores. Whereas Cipla Health derives its growth from 5 anchor brands, which are well over INR100 crores in trailing 12 months. In South Africa, big brands have been the key reason for growth in our OTC business. Cipla Actin, Coryx and Broncol are now tracking in the range of ZAR 100 million in the trailing 12 months. Acquisition of Actor Pharma has recently received the approval of the competition commission, and integration is expected to be completed in quarter 4 of FY 24. Actors portfolio includes products with great potential of becoming the next set of big brands. Investments -- the third theme is the investments in the pipeline -- in the future pipeline, and this remains one of our key themes. R&D investment is focused on funding developmental efforts and filing new products. In this quarter, we were successful in filing 2 products to complement our respiratory portfolio in the U.S. We have completed filing of generic Symbicort and 1 other generic inhalation asset for which we should provide details in our next call. In line with our strategy of lung leadership, we have continuously focused on investing in the pipeline over the years with number of assets in high single digits. Some of these assets are already Cipla Limited January 25, 2024 filed. On our peptide portfolio, we are ready with one peptide asset and waiting for its approval to launch, while there are 4 launches planned in FY 25. We are also working on several other peptide 505(b)2 opportunities and complex products, which are currently under development and will be key to the future portfolio. Our focus continues on regulatory efforts in Goa and Indore. Earlier in this quarter, we have updated you of the warning letter we had received for the Indore facility, which was audited in February 23. We have duly responded to queries from USFDA and are now focusing on remediation. In Goa -- at Goa, we have submitted all the pending acquisitions. Derisking our top launches remains our top priority. Derisking of Advair has been progressing as per expectation. We expect to file this asset in mid FY 25. For generic Abraxane, we are more likely to launch this fastest from the Goa facility. Given the complexity of the product, third-party transfer has been time consuming and will take longer compared to a launch from our Goa facility. I would now like to invite Mr. Ashish Adukia, our CFO.",

      "content": "Thank you, Mr. Umang Vohra. This quarter, we progressed further with exceptional performance across core businesses with expansion in profitability. Coming to the key financial highlights for the quarter, the numbers are adjusted for QCIL disinvestment, which was completed in this quarter. We are pleased to report a quarterly revenue of INR 6,544 crores, with a healthy growth of 14% driven by flagship businesses of India, North America and South Africa. EBITDA margin stood at impressive 26.3% for the quarter. As per practice, this EBITDA margin does not include other income. Expansion and operating profitability is largely due to favourable mix, calibrated price action across branded and generic portfolio, and impact of easing cost inflation. Gross margin after material cost stood at 66.3% for the quarter, which is 90 basis points above last years figures, driven by overall mix change, again, contribution from new launches as well as lower procurement cost of key APIs. The total expenses for the quarter include employee costs and other expenses, which stood at INR2,621 crores, which was flat on a sequential basis. R&D investments for the quarter are at INR400 crores, which is 6.1% of the revenue, driven by product filings, development efforts and is higher by 10% on quarter -- Y-o-Y basis. Extraordinary expenses mainly include impairment of intangible asset and winding down provision of Pulmazole, which was one of our products that we were developing with Pulmatrix, Inc. for the U.S. market. While weve impaired the entire asset, we may look at continuing to develop and launch this asset in India and other markets. Profit after tax for the quarter is at INR1,049 crores or 16% of sales, and the ETR is constant at 27.5%. Free cash generation and operating efficiency strives a healthy cash -- net cash position. Weve repaid all our long-term loans, including the term debt that we had in South Africa of ZAR 720 million. With this, as of 31 December 23, the gross debt on the balance sheet is only about Cipla Limited January 25, 2024 INR449 crores, which constitutes lease liabilities and working capital facilities. Cash equivalent balance as on the date stands at INR7,591 crores. The key focus areas and growth levers in the subsequent quarters will include priorities for One- India, would be to grow in Rx led by chronic portfolio, sustained leadership in GX, while working on further strengthening growth levers for wellness portfolio. In North America, our focus would be on commercial execution of existing portfolio and resolution of USFDA observations. Product launches through delisting strategy and as well as inorganic partnerships and acquisitions will remain one of our key priorities for the U.S. market. Build on performance in South Africa, aided by growth in private and select tender business with greater emphasis on margin expansion. In emerging markets and Europe, top priority is to improve top line while margins are maintained at sustainable levels. As per the yearly trend, quarter 4 will have an impact of weaker seasonality in India and North America. EBITDA margin for the full year is trending at a higher end of what we had guided earlier, which was a range of 23% to 24%. The RoIC continues to be very healthy at about 29% for the trailing 12 months. I would like to thank you for your attention and request the moderator to now take the questions.",

      "content": "Thank you, Ajinkya, and good evening to everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call for financial year 2024. In FY 24, we recorded our highest ever revenue and EBITDA, including major milestones across our flagship businesses of One-India, North America and South Africa. Our One-India revenue reached the threshold of INR10,000 crores, North America crossed $900 million and South Africa reached the top spot in Prescription business in the country. To make this journey sustainable, we are continuing our investments across the complex pipeline, the CapEx, the big brands and the operations. Im pleased to share that we finished this fiscal with significant progress in our top priorities. Our first priority, we continued market-leading growth in our focus markets. Our One-India business posted a healthy growth of 10% for this year, propelled by traction in the Branded Prescription and Trade Generics, while Consumer Health was impacted by seasonally slower market. Our Branded Prescription business continued to outpace the market growth in this quarter with Cipla growing 100 basis points ahead of the market as per IQVIA Q4 FY 24. This performance was largely backed by respiratory and cardiac therapies, which grew 10% each, respectively. Chronic therapies now have a share of 61% in the portfolio, higher by almost 100 basis points year-on-year and grew at 10% year-on-year versus IQVIA MAT March 24. To improve our offerings, we were adding a niche set of innovative products like inhaled insulin, plazomicin, et cetera in our portfolio. We have a pipeline of similar assets which are currently under various stages of development. Cipla Limited May 10, 2024 In this fiscal, our Trade Generics recorded a double-digit year-on-year growth, further consolidating its leadership position in the market. Strong execution in key therapies, deepening distribution network in Tier 2-6 cities and 40-plus new launches as well as technological interventions were the key drivers for the growth this year. With a view to consolidate our distribution channel, we recently changed our model to increase the direct touch points, which will help us with improved trade visibility and will position us closer to the market. We are confident that this change will help us unlock the immense potential in the Trade Generics market in India. The consumer health franchise was flat year-on-year in a year adversely impacted by seasonality while operating profitability continues to be sustainable. Recent improvement in the demand cycle and inorganic investments will help this business scale up further in the upcoming fiscal. In North America, we reported an all-time high annual revenue of $906 million, which was 24% growing over the previous year. The performance was led by traction in differentiated portfolio and sustained demand for the base business. In Lanreotide, we have scaled the product to achieve a market share of 20.8% as per IQVIA Feb 24, which itself is a benchmark in the 505 (b)(2) market. In Abuterol, our market share was in the range of 12% to 13% at the end of the year. We have a strategy in place to improve this market share by a few more percentage points. The market share has already increased to 15.5% as per the prescription data for April 24. Overall, we continue to be one of the fastest-growing among the top 5 companies. Recently, we achieved a leadership position in the pharma prescription for the South Africa market as per IQVIA MAT March 24. Here, again, we recorded 11.2% year-on-year growth in secondary versus a market growth of 2.1% as per IQVIA MAT March 24. In OTC, we have fastest growth amongst the top 5 players in the market and aspire to be ranked #2 in the near future. Our second priority has been about investing in the future organically and inorganically. Our organic investments have been focused towards investing in R&D, primarily for our U.S. markets. In Respiratory, we have filed 5 assets, including Symbicort and generic QR with launches expected within 3 years. Further, we are targeting to file 2 respiratory assets with significant revenues in the next 12 to 15 months. In peptides and complex generics, 12 assets are already filed with most launches in 2 to 4 years. As alluded earlier, we strive to launch 4 peptide assets in FY 25. We are also working on several 505 (b)(2) opportunities in complex ANDA products, which are currently under development and will be key to our future portfolio. For organic partnerships and investments, we have been very mindful of the choices to allocate capital. Earlier this year, we invested in Actor Pharma, which stands fully integrated as on date and is expected to help accelerate our South Africa OTC portfolio in FY 25. Recently, we entered into a marketing and distribution partnership with Sanofi to expand the reach of CNS portfolio in India. In line with our focus to enhance our chronic portfolio. In Cipla Health, Cipla Limited May 10, 2024 we entered into a brand acquisition for the cosmetic and personal care business of Ivia Beaute Private Limited, which includes their flagship brand Astaberry to bolster our India OTC portfolio. During the year, we disinvested our QCIL portfolio and focus on allocating our capital to other growth projects, while we continue to serve Africa through our Global Access business. In the past year, the U.S. FDA audited 3 of our facilities based in the U.S. and issued either a VAI or 0483 observations. Our new facility in China, which has capabilities in manufacturing respules for local markets as well as the U.S. also cleared the U.S. FDA audit with 0483 observations. We expect to start supplies of the respules to U.S. from China a strong amount in the second half of FY 25. Meanwhile, a Goa Unit 5 unit cleared GP audit by the MHRA U.K. earlier this year. Recently, 2 of us the Patalganga and Kurkumbh also underwent the U.S. FDA audit. The Patalganga facility was issued with six 483 observations and the Kurkumbh audit ended with 1 observation. We await the official classification for both the sites. In Goa, we have now finished remediation equities and are ready for the U.S. FDA while at indoor, we are focusing on getting the plant remediated. I would now like to invite Ashish Adukia to present the financial and operational performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Umang. I would like to now present key financial highlights for the quarter and financial year 2024. To clarify, the numbers are adjusted for QCIL disinvestment, which was completed earlier this year. We are pleased to report our quarterly revenue of INR6,163 crores with a healthy Y-o-Y growth of 10% driven by our focused markets. As a result of this quarter, we ended the year at INR25,455 crores with revenue growing 14% Y-o-Y. The EBITDA margin for the quarter stood at 21.4% versus last year of 20.45%, almost 100 basis points improvement. And for the year, the EBITDA margin was 24.5% as against last year of 22.2%, again, 200 basis points beat. Gross margin after material costs stood at 66.7% for the quarter, which is 192 basis points over last year. The gross margin for the year is at 66% higher by 200 basis points Y-o-Y. Expansion and profitability is largely due to favorable mix, calibrated price actions across branded and generic portfolio and impact of easing cost inflation. Total expenses for the quarter include employee cost and other expenses, which stood at INR2,797 crores, higher by 6.7% on sequential basis. Annually, the expense were INR10,572 crores, higher by 13% Y-o-Y. R&D investments for the quarter are at INR444 crores or 7.2% of revenue against our yearly average of 6% to 7%, driven by product, filing costs and developmental efforts higher in the quarter by 19% versus last year. Overall for the year, the R&D investment stood at INR1,571 crores or at 6.2% of the revenue. Profit after tax for the quarter is at INR939 crores at 15% of sales, ETR at 25.8%. Full year profit after tax stands at INR4,106 crores at 16% of sales and ETR at 27.1%. Our capital investments for the year were INR1,315 crores, out of which 70% was invested towards growth and improving our capacities and capabilities while the balance was deployed towards maintenance and sustainability. Free cash generation and operating efficiencies has resulted in a healthy cash position, as at the end of the year, the gross debt on our balance sheet is INR559 crores, which also constitutes the Cipla Limited May 10, 2024 lease liabilities and working capital facilities. Cash equivalent balance as on the date stands at INR8,267 crores. Looking forward, our key focus areas for FY 25 will be growth for One-India led by Rx, where our aspiration continues to grow higher than IPM backed by chronic portfolio. Efforts in Trade Generics will be channelized towards smooth transitioning to the new operating model for a long- term benefit. This may have an impact for a quarter, but over the year, we hope to recover. Cipla Health should be backed by -- on its growth trajectory after a difficult year impacted by seasonally slower demand. In North America, the aspiration will be to grow our top line, Y-o-Y, primarily backed by commercial execution of existing portfolio and new launches. We remain focused on resolution of U.S. FDA observations, derisking our product launches. We would continue to explore inorganic partnerships and acquisitions. Growth in South Africa supported by private and select tender business with priority on margin improvement. In EMEU, the top priority is to improve top line while margins are maintained at a sustainable level. ROIC continues to be very healthy at around 31% for the last year. We aim to deploy INR1,500 crores in capital investments to enhance our manufacturing capability and improve sustainability. EBITDA margin for the full year is expected to be up 200 basis points over last year, which should result in the range of about 24.5% to 25.5% to EBITDA margin. Id like to thank you for your attention and would request the moderator to open for the questions.",

And now what we have done is that, that converts into only a marketing agent, okay? So it will only be a commission, and well directly deal with the stockist underlying that sole agent. So we will have direct connect with the stockist now. Now this requires a little bit of administrative changes, et cetera due to which there can be some hiccups in the first quarter as we transition with the Direct Connect. But over a period of time, like I said, it will ease out to normal growth. On the second question, this split, we usually -- we dont give that split. Its the same split as both have grown trade carriers slightly higher than the Rx market. So the split is broadly same as it has been in the previous year. Cipla Limited May 10, 2024",

When it comes to U.S. portfolio, partnership or in-licensing, products, et cetera. There, I think it wont be a large acquisition, and it will be a lot focused on product where there is some differentiation available, either it could be supply constraint or lower competition due to many reasons. I would be interested in such opportunities out there so that it has a longer life in the market. Umang, if you want to add, please go ahead, yes.",

We dont see more than a 20% overlap between what sells in the Tier 2 to 6 cities in our generics business versus what sells in these cities Cipla Limited May 10, 2024 from our Rx or Prescription business. There is very little of the Prescription business that filters down to Tier 2 to 6 towns. And therefore, we believe that the generic business, as penetration of healthcare deepens, is only going to expand in volumes. Its not going to decrease. Having said that, and as I mentioned earlier to Saion, the business is still a branded business. And the salience and relevance of brands is very important. So the older the brand and the more current of therapy, the business will continue to grow. And over the last 2 years or 3 years, we have been diversifying ourselves away from a pure chronic orientation in this part of the business. So we feel competition is good. It will drive definitely growth higher, but we dont see this business as cannibalizing the branded business in any way -- the Branded Prescription business in any way. Thats number one. Number two, we think the market is big enough to drive further penetration through the competition activities; and three, businesses, which have been historically present and have large branded franchisees because thats essentially what the generic business is, are actually on a firmer ground compared to some of the newer entrants.",

I think we have strategic partnerships with a lot of people, some of whom consolidate with us. And typically, its easier to consolidate manufacturing in sales in U.S. than it is in injectable facility than it is in dermatological facilities.

Look, I think while we have Revlimid in our numbers today, we are also constrained by the inability to launch several products from our facilities due to their citation. And some of these products are fairly -- can be fairly material to the trajectory of this -- of our company. So I think thats the first thing that we should just keep in mind that as some of these facilities become citation free, there will be an opportunity to launch those portfolios. Second, as Ashish mentioned, were also preparing for a post Revlimid scenario. It is not just pipeline and portfolio, but also a fair and significant amount of effort for the organization on the cost front and that exercise has started. The third aspect is we continue to see robust growth in India, and a large portion of that growth hopefully will stay and continue to stay profitable as we expand into the interiors. So we are seeing growth coming from there. We are seeing growth coming from our emerging markets and new franchise, which has historically been flat. And we see a pipeline that will support Revlimid going away. Some of which is pending just inspections, some of which is actively under review along with our cost program. So thats how we look at our business transformation.",

Where we are today is that we believe most of these have bottomed out. And we see that this is a very good base to possibly show growth now going forward. Also, our pipeline in Europe should hopefully unlock. Weve been building that over the past 2 to 3 years. And so if you add those 2 together, while we are not guiding to say that the business is going to triple or double or thats not where we are going, but I think we should hopefully be able to see a respectable double-digit growth in this segment.",

So you could actually say that after the audit, it will still take about 3 to 6 months for assets to start getting clear. So it completely depends on the timing of the audit.

      "content": "Thank you, Diksha, and good afternoon to all. Just -- Umang should be joining shortly. So in the meantime, Ill just start off. Let me just touch upon some of the highlights of the quarter before I get into the details. Our branded prescription business grew by 10% year-on-year, over a high base of last year with chronic share, further improving by 106 basis points year-on-year to about 61.5% as per IQVIA MAT June 24. The transition of the India trade generic business into a new distribution model is fully complete, and it got completed towards the end of quarter 1. The business is already back on its trajectory growth in quarter 2. North America reached all-time high quarterly revenue of $250 million. We also launched the generic version of Lanreotide injection during this quarter. South Africa prescription business continued to outpace market growth, thus consolidating its number one position as per IQVIA MAT May 24. From our recent inspections at Patalganga and Kurkumbh facilities, the U.S. FDA has classified them as VAI. This further builds on our past inspections at our overseas facilities of InvaGen and China. Id like to cover the performance in a little bit more detail now, starting with updates on our performance in key markets. India branded prescription business grew at 10%, like I said, Adjusting for our GX model change, if you had assumed a normalized growth rate of trade generic, the quarter 1 growth of One-India would be close to about 9% versus a reported figure of about 5% Y-o-Y. We continue to outpace market growth in key chronic therapies. Respiratory grew by 9%. Growth for cardiac was at 11%, while urology recorded a growth of 15%. Supported by improvement in chronic mix, we have been able to breach the revenue threshold of INR12,000 crores in the IPM IQVIA MAT June 24. Performance of our big brands was one of the highlights for the quarter again. In branded prescription, we have added 2 new brands in Cipla Limited July 26, 2024 the category of revenue over INR100 crores. We now have a total of 24 brands in this category. As for IQVIA MAT June 24 forecast continues to lead IPM followed by our 20 brands in the IPM Top 300. Through the transition of distribution model in the trade generic business, we have increased the direct touch points with the distributors. This helps us in deepening our channel connect with the help of retail task force, which connects more than 1.5 lakh chemists. Furthermore, the business is expected to generate operational efficiencies due to delayering of distributors. We have completed this transition at the end of Q1 FY 25 ahead of our internal estimates. I would like to thank the business leadership as well as our partners for smooth completion of this process. While business has been slow in this quarter, we are already back on track to accelerate the journey through continuous expansion in offering and reach to further consolidate its leadership position in the market in upcoming quarters. Our Consumer Health franchise posted a growth of 3% Y-o-Y due to high base and an exceptionally strong summer in the last year. Anchor brands of Nicotex, Omnigel, Cisplatin grew to leadership position in their respective segments. The business continues to look for opportunities to invest in products and channels to bolster its distribution network. The operating profitability remains consistent in the range of 15% to 16%, and we expect higher growth quarters in the rest of the year. In North America, we yet again achieved an all-time high quarterly revenue of $250 million by growing 13% over last year, supported by positive traction in our differentiated portfolio. In albuterol, we have captured or rather recaptured our gaining -- our market share by gaining it by 4% in this quarter. Our market share now stands at 17% as per IQVIA week ended 21st June 2024. In our 505(b)(2) asset of Lanreotide, we maintained our market share of 20% during the quarter. To enhance our Lanreotide franchise, we also launched a generic version, which is the biggest peptide launches for FY 25. The product continues to witness strong demand signals in the market. In South Africa, we recorded strong double-digit growth of 19% Y-o-Y in local currency terms, led by private market. In private market, our secondary growth was at a healthy 7.8% versus the market growth of 1.7%. While our prescription business maintained its number one ranking asked by IQVIA MAT May 24. This growth was propelled by uptick in key therapies, new launches as well as significant growth in OTC portfolio. A part -- a key part of our global wellness agenda, our South Africa OTC business demonstrated a growth of 19% during the quarter. Our big brands have been a key success to our success in this region with 8 brands with revenues over ZAR100 million. In addition to this, we have the highest number of brands in top 10, top 50 and top 100 with the generics segment as per IQVIA MAT May’24. Our EMEU business delivered a healthy growth of 7% in USD terms with accelerated growth in DTM segment, along with sustained overall margin. Cipla Limited July 26, 2024 The business has also added China as one of its key markets during the quarter. Resolution of regulatory issues remains our top priority. Our Goa facility recently underwent reinspections by U.S. FDA. The facility was issued six 483 observations. Official classification is awaited. And while at Indore, our focus remains on remediation and implementation of CAPA. Coming to some of the key numbers. We reported a quarterly revenue of INR6,694 crores, with a growth of 7%, driven by our core businesses of India, North America and South Africa. Our EBITDA margins, excluding other income, stood at impressive 25.6% for the quarter, increasing by 154 basis points. Our EBITDA improved by 30% Q-o-Q and 14% Y-o-Y. And all these numbers, let me clarify, is ex QCIL, both revenue growth that I talked about as well as EBITDA. Calibrated pricing actions in core portfolio across branded and generic market, lower operating costs and favorable forex led to improve operating profitability. Reported gross margin after material costs stood at 67.2% for the quarter, which is 226 basis points above last years figures, driven by overall mix change. Total expenses for the quarter include employee costs and other expenses, which stood at INR2,785 crores, which is in line with the revenue growth. Our R&D expenses for the quarter are at INR353 crores at 5.3% of revenue, driven by product filing costs and development efforts, higher in the quarter by 1% versus last year. The profit after tax for the quarter is at INR1,178 crores or 17.6% of sales with effective tax rate at 27%. Our free cash flow generation and operating efficiency continues to drive healthy net cash position. As at 30th June 2024, debt on our balance sheet is INR547 crores constituting lease liability as well as working capital. Cash equivalent balance is touching close to about INR9,000 crores. Key focus areas and growth levers in the subsequent quarters will include priority for One-India would be to continue to grow ahead of market. In branded prescription, swift recovery from momentary softness due to moderate change in trade generics while working on strengthening our growth levers for wellness portfolio, including ramping up the recent acquisition of Astaberry. In North America, our focus would be on commercial execution, expediting the launches from our U.S. facilities and maximizing value from our launches in peptide portfolio. Derisking key launches for FY 25 continues to remain our key priority. In South Africa, our focus state that margin expansion in EMU, our top priority is to maximize top line with focus and deepening penetration in core markets with sustaining the strong margin trajectory. As guided, our EBITDA for the year is trending in the range of 24.5% to 25.5% and ROIC is well over 30%. Id like to thank you and hand it over to the moderator for Q&A.",

I think that is a correct observation, but Id also say at the same time that we have nanopaclitaxel, we have Advair, we have a couple of other respiratory products that we also hope to launch, which could be meaningful opportunities as well as soon as we can launch them.

      "content": "Thank you, Diksha. Good afternoon to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today for our 2nd Quarter Earnings Call. This quarter, we yet again delivered a strong profitability. The reported EBITDA margin stood at 26.7% for the quarter, which is our highest ever quarterly EBITDA margin thats reported by Cipla. Growth in EBITDA outpaced topline growth of 9% year-on-year, which was primarily impacted due to a change seasonal pattern. I would now like to start with the updates on our key markets: Our One India business witnessed a slow seasonal growth, especially in the acute category. In anti-infectives, one of our largest therapies, the market growth came at 4.9% as against the last year growth of over 12% as per IQVIA MAT September ‘24. This impacted both our branded prescription as well as the trade generics business. On an overall basis, One India growth stood at 5% year-on-year. Our endeavor is to outpace the market growth on a full year basis. With the revival in the season and the respiratory uptick starting in quarter 3 of this year, we should revert back to our growth trajectory. While we are seeing slower growth, we have continued to invest both in field force and investments in the field. Our number of people on the field has now reached 8,700 people. Cipla Limited October 29, 2024 During the quarter, our branded prescription business continued to outpace market growth in chronic therapies. Respiratory grew by 9%, cardiac grew by 11, and urology by 15%. Our share of chronic also improved to 61.5% as per IQVIA MAT September ‘24. Performance of our big brands was one of the key highlights for this quarter. In our branded prescription business, we have added three new brands in the category of revenue of over Rs. 100 crores. We now have a total of 25 brands in this category, along with 21 brands in top 300, as per IQVIA MAT September ‘24. Cipla continues to be the largest pharma company in terms of volume and the only player with 2-billion+ unit sales in IPM as per the IQVIA MAT September ‘24. In our trade generics business, the business is impacted by the season. However, we expect it to revert to the usual growth trajectory in the coming quarters. Our Consumer Health business witnessed strong traction with anchor in transition brands continuing to grow bigger. The business posted a robust growth of 20% plus. Anchor brands of Nicotex, Omnigel, and Cipladine maintained their leadership position in their segments. The business is focused on driving a very healthy secondary growth and tries to look for opportunities to invest in products and channel to strengthen the distribution network. The operating profitability of our business is consistent at 15%. In North America, we delivered a quarterly revenue of $237 million. Barring a temporary supply issue in Lanreotide, the sustenance in revenue has been supported by continued positive traction in our differentiated portfolio. Albuterol further enhanced its market share to 19% in this quarter. The Lanreotide franchise consisting of 505(b)(2) and ANDA assets reached the market share of 35% during the quarter as per IQVIA MAT-24. Currently, we are facing some supply challenges in Lanreotide, and hence we expect the Quarter 3 Lanreotide franchise sales to be lower than quarter 2. However, these issues are anticipated to be resolved by the end of Quarter 3, and starting quarter four FY25, we should be able to recover sharply in the Lanreotide franchise. Were also working to increase the overall capacity of Lanreotide through CAPEX investments made by our partner. During this quarter, we also received four new generic drug approvals, including one peptide in the US market. Progressing on our journey of strengthening the Africa story, we now have merged the North Africa business, which was part of EMU with the SAGA region and renamed it as One Africa. Our overall One Africa business recorded a vigorous growth of 22% with South Africa also delivering a similar growth in local currency terms. In the private market, our secondary growth was at a healthy 8.6% versus the market growth of 0.5%. Our South Africa private market now ranks number two in the market with the prescription business maintaining its number one position. North Africa also demonstrated a strong growth during this quarter. In EMEU, our deep market strategy has started paying off with the business delivering a solid growth of 18% in US dollar terms, with a pickup in both our DTM and B2B categories. Cipla Limited October 29, 2024 I will now cover some of the issues regarding the regulatory inspections. Resolution of our regulatory issues remains our top priority. Our Goa facility recently underwent re-inspection by the US FDA. The facility was issued six 483 observations. We are still waiting for the classification of the inspection. At Indore, our focus remains on remediation and implementation of the CAPA. De-risking of generic Advair, our major inhalation asset, has been progressing as per expectations. We expect to launch this asset in the half-one of FY26. For generic Abraxane, while we are more likely to launch it from our Goa facility, this may require approval for the facility, impacting the timeline of the launch. We have continued with our efforts to de-risk the product through the CMO site. On the sustainability front, we have had some good progress. During the quarter, Cipla achieved ranking with the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, and the score has improved to 79 from 70 that was there in the previous year. To summarize: The overall company outlook, we are on track to achieve our margin guidance for the year. That is between 24.5%, 25.5%. Last 12 months have been audit heavy with our facilities of Invagen, Kurkumbh, Patalganga, China and Goa audited. All these facilities have cleared with either a VAI or NAI except for Goa where the classification is still awaited. In Lanreotide, we are in the process of resolving our supply issues. Our trade generics business, the model change has been successfully implemented and we now have a better control on the channel. With this, I would now like to turn the call over to Ashish for the financial and the operating performance.",

We reported a quarterly revenue of Rs. 7,051 crore with a growth of 9% driven by our core businesses of India, North America, South Africa, as well as EMEU. The EBITDA margin excluding other income stood at an impressive 26.7% for the quarter, up by about 70 basis points YoY and 111 basis points QoQ basis. The reported gross margin after material costs stood at 67.6% for the quarter which is 159 basis points above last years figures, mainly driven by overall better mix. Total expenses for the quarter include employee expense as well as other expenses that stood at Rs. 2882 crore. The employee expenses includes our strategic investments which Umang also mentioned in the India branded prescription business via field force, especially on the chronic therapies. Between FY23 and H1 FY25, we have added almost 1,500 plus feet on ground. As Cipla Limited October 29, 2024 highlighted earlier, we have also introduced retail task force in India trade generic business, a team of almost 500 plus feet on ground for better visibility and control over business, leading to improved customer relationship. These investments will help us meeting our long-term organizational growth goals. Increase in other expenses is on account of new launches in India branded prescription business, so its an investment towards that. It also includes commencement of our plant operations in China, which is expected to start supplies in this financial year itself, and investment in our MDI facility in Fall River for filing new products and de-risking some of our existing pipelines. R&D investments for the quarter are at Rs. 385 crore or 5.5% of the revenue, driven by product filing costs and developmental efforts higher in the quarter by 2% versus last year. Profit after tax for the quarter is at Rs. 1,303 crore or about 18.5% of sales with the effective tax rate at 27%. Our free cash generation and operating efficiency continues to drive healthy net cash position. As at September 2024, a debt on our balance sheet including the lease liabilities stood at Rs. 461 crore with net cash equivalent balance of Rs. 7950 crore. This quarter we had paid out a dividend of Rs. 1000 plus crore. Now I will conclude with key focus areas and growth levers in the subsequent quarters. The priority for One India would be to continue to grow ahead of the market in branded prescription and accelerating the growth trajectory in trade generics while further working on solidification of the growth levers for wellness portfolio including ramping up in new launches. In North America, our focus would be on commercial execution, expediting the launches from our US facilities, and resolving the supply issues that we talked about. De-risking key launches for FY25 remains one of our key priorities. In South Africa, our continued focus stays at margin expansion, and in EMEU, our top priority is to maximize topline with focus on deepening our penetration in identified core markets while sustaining the strong margin trajectory. Our ROCE for the quarter on an annualized basis was 30% plus. And like Umang said, our EBITDA guidance remains unchanged at 24.5% to 25.5%. I would like to thank you for your attention and would like to hand over now to the moderator for Q&A.",

Okay, this is more opportunistic, where we make good margin is where we participate. And we did some vaccine tenders as well, which has helped us to grow that. And tender business will always depend on tenders coming in as well as the margin that we are making. So, it will sustain, but it can also certain quarters may be different. The other reason for the performance is also now a fully integrated actor, which was not there in the previous quarter. So that has also added to OTC as well as Rx. And this is going to be sustained, this will sustain because actor is now part of our portfolio. So well add to growth through actor. And the third thing I would like to highlight is that we have been constantly focusing on new launches in South Africa which has also helped us to grow faster than the market. So yes, it is a big difference but these are some of the levers which have helped us and will continue to help us to grow fast for other market.",

      "content": "Hi, good evening. My first question was regarding the India business. If you can give some color, particularly on trade generics and consumer, so do you think trade generics has recorded growth this quarter compared to last year given the restructuring we have done? And also on consumer, I remember last year was muted. We had seen like 21% growth this quarter. Why are we seeing sort of that volatility and whats more of sustainable growth here?",

      "content": "So trade generic I think couple of things, one is season, while distribution model issue that we talked about in the quarter, one which had impacted the financials is complete and there is no reason, thats not the reason for growth not to be normal. I think the season like we talked about in anti-infectives has been weak and its primarily an acute portfolio so thats been an issue. And also its certain regulatory changes in certain FDC products etc. has also impacted part of the sales. So overall trade generic is more or less a very small increase over on YoY basis. On CHL, I think we have seen a very smart rebound. I think last year like you said was muted so now this is more normalized growth that we have seen, its also the growth has been supported by the Astaberry acquisition that we made albeit it should not be very large. But yes, we have seen some growth coming from there as well, out of the 21% growth that we saw in overall CHL. And this growth should sustain because there are strong brands and we are working on growing them.",

Second, I think the topline has expanded quite significantly, which is why youre seeing the percentage coming down a bit. But overall, I think in terms of new areas, oligonucleotides, were looking at that. Peptides, we have almost completed our full portfolio. Were looking at respiratory assets next year, thats coming up. Our bio asset that we are developing, that has moved into, well be moving to phase one.

Im pleased to share that 2025 marks our 90th year in the journey of “Caring For Life.” Its an exciting time for us to move forward on our innovation-led and care driven commitment to provide the best healthcare solutions across the globe. We are fully committed to do our best in providing healthcare with a focus on equitable access so that no one should be denied of medication. Cipla looks forward to another decade of science, innovation and technology. Over the past three years, we have been we have been derisking our manufacturing network and products to our US facilities. Between fiscal year 20 to year-to-date fiscal year 25, we have spent almost $100 million of CAPEX in these facilities. With this enhancement, we now have DPI, MDI and existing large volume OSD facilities in the US. Filings from these facilities have already commenced, including the filing of generic Advair, a major inhalation asset. The backlog of our key assets of generic Advair, generic Abraxane and one partnered inhalation asset have the potential to help us grow the US top line post-generic Revlimid. Cipla Limited January 28, 2025 We also have created a well-diversified business portfolio. As youre aware our EMEU and One Africa businesses put together accounts for more than 25% of the companys total revenue, similar in size to our U.S. business. In nine months of fiscal year 25, both of these markets combined have delivered a strong growth of 15% year-on-year in INR terms. Our diversification and backlog of our launch pipeline gives us confidence of a resilient business model. In FY26, we retain our guidance to grow our top line. We will further provide guidance on profitability once we finalize our budget. Coming to the “Quarter Performance.” Despite seasonal headwinds, especially in the acute category, our One India business delivered a healthy growth of 10% year-on-year. In our Branded Prescriptions business, we continue to outpace market growth in our key therapies of respiratory, urology and acute with the overall chronic mix improved to 61.5% year- on-year as per MAT IQVIA December 24. Our big brand franchises continue to achieve key milestones during the quarter. Foracort continues to be the number one brand in IPM. We added five brands with the revenue of over 100 crores in the IPM to reach a total of 26 brands with revenue greater than 100 crores. We now have seven therapies with the top five rank in the IPM. We continue to be the largest pharma company in terms of volume and the only player with 2 billion plus unit sales in IPM as per the IQVIA MAT December 24. During this quarter, we launched CipAir, an AI powered mobile application to simplify asthma screening in India. In our trade generics business, we are back on the growth trajectory. The performance was supported by execution excellence in distribution, new introductions and technological interventions. Our consumer health business witnessed strong traction with anchor brands continuing to grow bigger. Our anchor brands Nicotex, Omnigel and Cipladine maintain leadership position and ranked number one in their market in the respective segments. We continue to build on this by driving healthy secondary growth and thrive to look for opportunities to invest in products and channel to strengthen our distribution network. The operating profitability of our consumer health business remains consistent. In North America, we delivered a quarterly revenue rate of $226 million. If adjusted for the supply disruption in Lamivudine, our revenue would have been on a growth trajectory. Albuterol market share further enhanced to 21% as per IQVIA MAT week ended 27th December 2024. Cipla Limited January 28, 2025 The business is on its way to resolve the supply issues related to Lanreotide and come back to normalized supply levels towards the end of Q4. We have also received various generic drug approvals including Phytonadione Injectable, Esomeprazole Granules and Potassium Phosphates Injection. Our One Africa business recorded a significant growth of 9% in U.S. dollar terms with South Africa growing at a rock solid 21% in ZAR terms. In our private market, our secondary growth was at a healthy 8.8% versus the market growth of 2%. Our South Africa private market now ranks #2 in the market with the prescription business maintaining its #1 position as per MAT November 24. North Africa also demonstrated strong growth during this quarter. In EMEU, our deep market focused strategy laid a strong foundation with the business delivering us a strong growth of 20% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms with the uptick in both our TTM and B2B categories. We also sustained our operating margins. We continue to invest in our pipeline for these markets with a focus on execution excellence. Ill now provide an Update on our Regulatory Front. As highlighted in the beginning, our Goa facility has been cleared by the US FDA with a VAI Classification. During this quarter, the USFDA also inspected our manufacturing facility located in Virgonagar, Bengaluru and issued eight 483 observations. Official classification is awaited. During this month, we were also inspected at our Medispray facility by the US FDA and issued one 483 observation. Official classification of this facility is also made. I will now request “Ashish to present the Financial and Operational Performance for this Quarter.”",

      "content": "Thank you, Umang. I would like to present the key financial highlights for the quarter. This quarter has been yet another quarter of highest ever quarterly revenue, and all-time high EBITDA margins, thats excluding the other income as we always do. All numbers as I talk about are adjusted for QCIL divestment, which is sitting in the previous year. So, we reported quarterly revenue of 7,073 crores with the growth of 8% YoY, driven by our core businesses of India, North America, South Africa and EMEU. Each of our markets other Cipla Limited January 28, 2025 than the US, which we already talked about grew at double digit YoY, One India at 10%, One Africa grew at 10% again and EMEU grew at 22% in INR terms. The EBITDA margin stood at impressive 28% for the quarter, up by 184 basis points YoY and 138 basis point QoQ. Reported gross margin after material cost stood at 68% for the quarter, which is 166 basis points above the last years figures driven broadly by overall mix change. The total expenses for the quarter include employee cost and other expenses, which stood at 2,820 crores in line with the revenue growth. Employee cost includes our strategic investments in India, branded prescription business, field force especially on the chronic therapies. From FY23 to nine months FY25 we have added 1,800 plus feet on ground. As highlighted earlier, we have also introduced retail task force in India and create generics business. A team of 500 plus feet on ground has been added for better visibility in the business. In addition to that, as we completed our trade generics model change, the employees of our marketing agent were onboarded, adding the cost to the employee cost, which will be set off against the reduction in the commission going forward. The R&D investment for the quarter is at 360 crores or about 5% of the revenue. It is primarily driven by product filing costs and developmental efforts. The R&D cost is likely to moderate as the requirement of clinical trials are relaxed, but we retain our guidance of 5% to 6% as it actually gives us an opportunity to add more product programs to our pipeline. The profit after tax for the quarter is at 1,571 crores or about 22% of sales and adjusted for one- off the effective tax rate is at 25.5%. Our free cash flow generation and operating efficiencies continues to drive a healthy net cash position. As of 31st December 2024, the debt on our balance sheet including lease liability stood at 466 crores with net cash equivalent balance of about 8,947 crores. Our unwavering efforts continued on derisking our assets for generic Advair, the derisking has been progressing as per expectation and we plan to launch this asset in late half one of FY26. And for Abraxane, we expect to launch it from our Goa facility post few months after the approval and the launch should largely be towards the back end of half two FY26. Now, I will conclude with the key focus area and growth levers in the subsequent quarter. The priority for One India would be to continue the growth momentum to be ahead of the market in growth, branded prescription and trade generic. We will further work on solidification of our growth levers for business portfolio, including ramping up in our new launches. Cipla Limited January 28, 2025 In North America, our focus would be to resolve supply issues, maximize the commercial execution and expedite the launches from our US facility. In South Africa, our focus stays at margin expansion. In EMEU, our top priority is to maximize top line with focus on deepening our penetration and identify growth markets while sustaining the strong margin trajectory. EBITDA for the year FY25 is trending higher than our earlier guidance that we have given, which was 24.5% to 25.5%. ROIC continues to be strong at 30%. Thanks for your attention. I would like to just hand it back to the moderator for Q&A.",

On the rest of the assets, Advair, we have still not launched and were signaling half two launch from the US facility. On Abraxane, we have a definite launch at least by the end of this next year and a few months after approval. I think the delays are largely due to regulatory clearance and filing and post that should follow. So, we believe that if we were to add a full year basis of Abraxane, and a full year basis of Advair, and a full year basis of the partnered inhalation asset, we believe that this is quite meaningful in the ability to offset share of the generic Revlimid production. It may not offset the total amount, but it will offset a significant portion.",

But, relative to the previous year where there was perhaps a higher pricing impact in the market than this year, that element of growth has slowed. So, for example, if the overall price increase that was allowed in the market last year was 3% or 4% versus that of this year, the general average is 1%, that 2% or 3% is offset from the overall growth in the market. We did see a slower volume offtake due to the season largely in the first two quarters of Cipla Limited January 28, 2025 the year, but that may have also been because of our transition, but it may have also been because there was a very, very slow season in this year too.",

But we have also been taking a lot of actions about optimizing our productivity, we have been taking actions about automating our processes, about improving the way our reps detail, and in the last 1.5, 2 years we have also expanded our field force, right, we have added fairly significant number of people. I think our view on India is that as the penetration in the market increases, the market offers a lot of opportunity. So, for us, yes, profitability has improved, but largely due to the fact that we have optimized our own productivity. Because if you really look at the last two years or three years, there have been hardly any price increases that anyone has been able to take. The weighted average ratio of price increases would not be higher than 2% or 3% in our case and so we have had to drive profitability growth just out of optimizing our productivity. And thats what our team has done in our India business. And I think as a result of that, we have kind of expanded our margin and use that to reinvest for more reps in the market.",

      "content": "Thank you, Diksha. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarters earnings call for financial year 2025. FY 25 marks a year of high milestones across our flagship businesses of One India, North America, One Africa and EMEU. Our One India business surpassed the landmark of INR11,000 crores revenues, reflecting our strength in the domestic market. North America saw remarkable progress with 3 key new drug approvals, further solidifying our foothold in the region. Meanwhile, our One Africa and EMEU businesses maintained strong growth momentum throughout all the 4 quarters, highlighting our commitment to sustainable expansion. Coming to our business performance. Our One India business posted a healthy growth of 8% year- on-year this quarter with a full year growth of 7% year-on-year, driven by substantial progress across the branded prescription, trade generics and consumer health business. This growth was realized despite seasonal challenges, particularly in the acute category, demonstrating the resilience and derisked business mix in a dynamic market landscape. In our branded business, our key chronic therapies of respiratory, cardiac and urology continued to outpace market growth. Our overall chronic mix further improved to 61.5% as per IQVIA MAT 25. Foracort, our leading inhalation brand became the first brand in the history of IPM to cross INR900 crores, reaffirming its position as a market leader. This year, we expanded our presence Cipla Limited May 13, 2025 in the IPM by adding 4 brands with revenues exceeding INR100 crores, bringing our total to 26. Additionally, we have increased our footprint to the top 300 ranks where we have 23 brands in the top 300 ranks. During the year, Cipla took strategic strides in expanding its portfolio through key partnerships with global players. We collaborated with Orchid Pharma for cefepime-enmetazobactam. In India, we joined forces with Takeda to bring vonoprazan, and we signed a multiregional licensing deal with Formosa for clobetasol suspension. To elevate our offerings, we will be launching innovative products like inhaled insulin and plazomicin backed by -- and are backed by a good pipeline of high potential assets in various stages of development. Our trade generics business continued its upward trajectory during the quarter on the back of vigorous execution and distribution, new launches and technological advancements. Expanding our portfolio remains a key pillar of our growth with 19 new introductions this year, further elevating our market presence. Our Consumer Health business delivered strong double-digit growth for the quarter as well as FY 25. Our anchor brands of Nicotex, Omnigel and Cipladine maintained leadership positions in their respective segments, securing the number 1 position in the market again. North America business achieved a quarterly revenue of $221 million with an all-time high annual revenue of $934 million, propelled by strong traction in the differentiated portfolio and consistent demand for our base business. Our albuterol market share remained steady at 18%. The quarter, we have begun to see supply normalization for Lanreotide, and we remain optimistic about reaching the previous levels from the earlier quarters. Additionally, apart from receiving a number of smaller approvals, we obtained 2 significant drug approvals this quarter, nano paclitaxel ANDA and the Nilotinib NDA approval. We have already launched and started selling nano paclitaxel in a couple of EMEU geographies and are hoping to do the same in the U.S. soon. Our One Africa business grew at an impressive 15% year-on-year during the quarter with a full year growth of 12% year-on-year in USD terms. In the private market, our secondary growth outpaced market growth at 6.7% versus 4.9%, enhancing our competitive edge. North Africa also recorded robust growth during the quarter, fortifying our presence across the region. In our EMEU business, a strategic focus on deep market penetration has established a solid foundation, delivering a quarterly revenue growth of 16% year-on-year and an annual revenue growth of 15% year-on-year. After 4 years of stable performance, our EMEU business is now entering a phase of growth. This performance was led by expansion across both DTM and B2B categories alongside consistent margin, stability and internal pipeline assets. Id like to update you about our U.S. pipeline. We remain committed to our organic investments with a strong focus on R&D for the U.S. market. In respiratory, we have filed 6 assets, including Cipla Limited May 13, 2025 Symbicort and Qvar, the generic versions of both, with launches expected in line with the review process. Four more respiratory assets will be filed in the next 12 to 18 months. We are now closer to commercializing generic Advair and are pleased by the promulgation signed with the administration for approving launches from U.S. facilities faster. In peptides and complex generics, 9 assets are already filed and some launches projected -- with some launches projected between FY 26 and 28. We aim to file 10 more peptides and complex generic assets in the next 12 to 24 months. We remain committed to launching 2 to 3 peptide assets in FY 26. Coming to the regulatory front. As youre aware that during the year, the U.S. FDA audited 5 of our manufacturing facilities based in India at Patalganga, Kurkumbh, Goa, Virgonagar and Medispray and all of these inspections have been classified as VAI. This accomplishment reflects our dedication to quality, compliance and operational excellence. I would now like to invite Mr. Adukia to present the financial and operational performance.",

And as highlighted earlier in other quarters as well, this is adjusted for QCIL numbers. In early part of the year, we had issued a range of performance, which we are happy to inform that we have now executed as per plan. We are pleased to report a quarterly revenue of INR 6,730 crores with a healthy Y-o-Y growth of 9%, driven by our focused markets. As a result, we ended the year at INR 27,548 crores with revenues growing 8% Y-o-Y. The EBITDA margin stood at 22.8% for the quarter, higher by 150 basis points Y-o-Y and 25.9% for the year, marginally exceeding our guidance which was higher by 139 basis points Y-o-Y. As per practice, this EBITDA margin does not include the other income. Gross margin after material costs stood at 67.5% for the quarter, which is 74 basis points above last years figure. The gross margin for the year stood at 67.6%, which is higher by 150 basis points -- 157 basis points Y-o-Y. Expansion and profitability is largely due to favorable mix, calibrated price actions across branded and generic portfolios and impact of easing cost escalations. Total expenses for the quarter include people costs and other expenses, which stood at INR3,003 crores, higher by about 7.4% on Y-o-Y basis. Annually, the expenses were INR11,491 crores, higher by 8.7% Y-o-Y. The R&D investments for the quarter are at INR426 crores, which is about 6.3% of revenue, driven by product filing cost, developmental efforts. Overall, for the year, the R&D investments stood at INR1,524 crores, which is at 5.5% of the revenue. For the quarter, PAT stands at INR1,222 crores, representing 18.2% of sales, with the effective tax rate of 18.6%. On a full year basis, PAT amounts to INR5,273 crores, accounting for 19.1% of sales, and the effective tax rate for the year is 22.4%. The slightly lower ETR in FY 25 is due to Cipla Limited May 13, 2025 reversals of previously recognized tax provisions and certain other adjustments. And even after adjusting for this impact, PAT continues to grow strong double-digit growth for the year, reinforcing the companys solid financial performance. ROIC continued to be strong at 30% plus for the year. Our free cash generation and operating efficiency endures to drive healthy cash net position. As of the year-end, debt on our balance sheet, including the lease liabilities stood at INR438 crores with net cash equivalent balance after adjusting for debt at INR10,369 crores. Looking forward, our key focus areas for FY 26 will continue to be priority for One-India, would be to continue the growth momentum to be ahead of the market in both branded prescription and trade generics. Well further work on cementing growth levers for wellness portfolio, including ramping up our new launches. In North America, our focus would be maximizing the commercial execution and expediting our new launches. In South Africa, as was the year before, our focus will be a margin expansion. EMEU, our top priority is to maximize top line with focus on deepening our penetration in identified core markets, while sustaining our strong margin trajectory. In terms of our FY 26 guidance, our business model and product pipeline remains resilient, leading to our revenue trajectory continuing in the growth path, and this is despite the generic Revlimid losing its exclusivity during the year. Our outlook for projected EBITDA margin is in the range of about 23.5% to 24.5%. Thats it from my side. Thank you for your attention, and now Ill request the moderator to please take the questions.",

So that will certainly have an impact on overall margin. And thats why we are guiding towards the margin number that weve given.",

I think -- so see, if you see in the last couple of years, weve actually increased our investments on the capex side. And these are all very strategic calls that we are taking to actually -- and to increase our capacities in respiratory capacities. And so most of the capex that you see are actually -- growth capex that you see are actually oriented to increase the respiratory capacity in MDI, DPI and rescues. Other than that, we also have our capex oriented towards derisking to the outside India facilities. So we have the China facility that got capitalized recently and the product supply has started from there. And then we have both facilities in the U.S. getting ready to start supplying MDI and DPI from there. And then you have a large maintenance capex as well, which is ongoing. So thats been our capex strategies, all oriented towards our strategic plan that we have in the future. On your second question, which was on GLP-1, okay? So I think Umang has covered in the past that well be ready whenever there is a first wave of launch that will come through. And we are looking at both in-house as well as third-party partnerships out there to make sure that we are in the first wave of launch. And your third question...",

You had sacubitril/valsartan. A lot of products went off patent and therefore, NI growth actually went up. And so therefore, you lost right -- compared to that and now you will see -- possibly 1%, 1.5% lower future growth due to the fact that the NI season, as you may call it, of expiries is gone. The second aspect is inflation used to be higher. So companies were given pricing adjustments, which was at inflation then. Inflation numbers are now lower, so you lose another 1% to 1.5% there. So what was a 10% to 12% range is now somewhere in the 8% to 10% range going forward for the industry. And Cipla will do better than that overall in India.",

Weve been investing on capex that I talked about. And well also continue to look at small to large M&A opportunities out there, which can come in the form of not just companies, but product portfolio, etcetera, that we may acquire out there. I think the second opportunity that we see is always adding to the portfolio in the U.S. So we keep looking at partnerships where complex -- where we can acquire complex generic ANDAs or NDAs, which requires you to pay some sort of milestone upfront, but then the asset is yours and you start to commercialize those assets. I think other than that, EMEU, we look at opportunistically acquisitions out there as well. It wont be large in size, but more midsized kind of an opportunity that well invest in. So we have many avenues to look at from a capital allocation point of view. And you would have seen that we have also accordingly maintained the dividend that we had increased in the last 2 years.",

So one is the Actor acquisition that we had made that helped us to grow out there on the OTC side primarily. Second is some opportunistic tenders that we did out there, which also helped us to grow out there. And the third is new launches that weve been doing. So our new launches share has been higher than our competition. So that has actually also helped us grow. But overall, if you look at the market, its a 4%, 5% market -- growth market. So I think on a normalized basis, we should take 4% to 5% kind of a growth for South Africa and not necessarily the beating growth that we have done because our focus will also be on the profitability there. Cipla Limited May 13, 2025 EMEU is a multitude of many markets. So therefore, it is difficult to give a number because there will be different growth rates in different markets. But I think we -- last year, we focused a lot on execution, which has helped us to achieve a 15% growth on USD terms. And like weve said that it has entered the growth phase. So next year also our target is to actually grow that in that market.",
