      "content": "A very warm welcome to everybody out here; very happy to have you back, especially when the results are so good. Im sure youve already gone through the results and a lot of youve already spoken to me and asked me a lot of questions. Indeed, when we began the year, we said the first two quarters are going to be little lackluster, but we did promise that the third quarter and fourth quarters, youll see a remarkable turnaround and more than that, actually. And we lived up to our own expectations. This fourth quarter, we closed our accounts with a record turnover, over INR 4,000 crores, for this particular quarter. Ive been advised that there are people from abroad joining in, and we have a call. So lets wait for a few more minutes. There are several qualitative aspects to our turnover for the quarter, of course, there is a 9% growth for the full year, when we speak about the performance vis-à-vis the previous quarter that is 22% up, 34% up vis-à-vis the last year itself. While these are a good set of numbers, we are happier with the gross margins performance also; 74% for this particular quarter and if you look at the performance for the year, it is 68.7% while it’s even higher than in the last year. It goes to show the quality of the products we launched in the market fourth quarter. Of course, it follows through with the EBITDA margins - which for this quarter was 34% whilst for the full year it is still a tad lower than the last year, but I would attribute that a very high R&D expenditure over Rs.500 crores, which would have translated another 3 percentage points. If we add both, we come to EBITDA margins even higher than last year. Of course, the PBT, again, despite the fact that the R&D expenditure was high - was higher than last year and if not for that for the higher quantum of tax, the PAT itself would have been considerably high. And on that last note, may I request Dr. KKS to make the presentation? Dr. Kamal K Sharma: Good Evening, Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you, Ramesh for those opening remarks. You’ve already seen the results, and Ramesh gave you a snapshot of where the financials have worked out. I think, I’m going to walk you through some of the industry trends as they are mopping, and how does Lupin that come in the face of those trends, and finally look at the quick dive into the financials, and end by saying as to what we are going to be doing, in the coming years. So, when we speak about the trends, something which has been very prominent in the recent past, is the erosion in prices in the US. And as you are aware that there has been substantial consolidation of the channel partners, and therefore it has obviously helped them to improve their bargaining power and the differential price in that one could earlier enjoy that is no more there. So, there is a block price for a group of channel partners, and I think the last one which happened was recently was Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 McKesson and Walmart, right. So, that really has been -- you know, generally, the US market -- Generic market will experience about 4% to 5% price reduction, of which at least 50% one would be able to make up through operational efficiencies but this particular episode has led to double-digit reduction to the tune of 14-15%. Of course, what is positive, is a better score on approvals by FDA. There has been substantial improvement in that area which had hithered towards deficient. When it comes to India, we are all aware that NLEM has set a new order as far as the Indian business is concerned. And whatever was the impact of the first NLEM policy, there has been further reinforced with what has happened in 2015 and the latest one that we have been dealing with is the ban on fixed dosage combinations, there is a temporary respite for part of them because we have a stay order but how it’s going to pan out is anybody’s guess. In sum and substance, there is a pressure on the business in terms of control on prices and ability to launch new products. Japan - the government has been progressively working towards improving the penetration of Generics, it is targeting 70% by 2017 and 80% by 2020. But on the other side, Japanese administration is also pushing prices down, I think, earlier we used to experience reduction in price every two years, now it’s become an annual feature which is not a very good news. There has been substantial consolidation in the industry in the last 2.5-years; M&A of $500 billion has happened and most of you have been reading in the papers of the major mergers which have taken place in the recent past. Another development which is worth citing here is that Biosimilars which is kind of a new wave in Generic market. They are now seeing a lot of traction on the guidelines, pathways from the regulators in Europe and in America and hopefully in the next few years there would be a lot more clarity in taking these to the markets. There are already instances where US is approving Biosimilars for the market. The year witnessed a lot of penalties from USFDA on the manufacturing plants. And while we have had a stellar record, we did not escape the heat and we will talk about that. Coming specifically to United States. What is in store for us in terms of trends, is that the Generic penetration is expected to rise from the current 88% to 92%. Between now and 2020 there is likelihood of $92 billion worth of patent expiration, which is an opportunity in Generics. This obviously augurs very well for the business. We also understand that the lion share of Generic goes to oral solid dosage forms, and a lot more needs to be done in the alternative forms. And the generic industry despite all the consolidation that we keep hearing about and we keep witnessing remains very Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 fragmented and in that sense if you see the top five operators in generics in the United States have lost their contribution from 55% to 51%, market share has come down. This is what I will say, meaning, when I said that the dominant share is with the Oral Solid Dosage form, in the slide that we see on the screen, you would see that there are 47 players in the OSD whereas as you go to the right of the slide you would see that there are a lesser number of players and there is a lot of concentration in the hands of few. The idea of sharing this information with you is to say that there is a lot of scope to grow in alternative dosage forms other than OSD and that’s what, is the world of Complex Generics and specialty which we’re pursuing in the company. What does this trending mean for Lupin in particular? I think we’ve already started our journey towards Complex Generics, we need to focus on it a lot more, we need to build Specialty both internally as well as through acquisition and partnerships. In India, I think the way the trends are, if we are going to be controlled on new launches, if there’s going to be price pressure, I think, the alternative is to increase your prescriber base and as we have demonstrated in the past we need to create more alliances: a) we need to go deeper into the existing alliances, as I speak with you we have four alliances in India with multinationals, and whatever we are doing with them, we need to go deeper, in addition, b) we need to tie up with more partners, so that the growth is ensured. Likewise in Japan, I think if one wants to deal with the price pressure, the only way it can be done is to launch more products and -- in order to do that I think we need to seek more strategic partnerships and of course we are already undertaking capacity expansion in Japan to be able to serve the market better. As far as M&A is concerned, I think we have stated in the past and our policy remains as we have said in earlier that Lupin would look at select areas of brand and specialty and niche technology platforms when it comes to merger and acquisitions. We’ve also stated earlier about our geographic expansion endeavor and I must say that in future you might witness some bolt-on acquisition, but by and large, as far as the geographic expansion is concerned for the company, we seem to be there, I think what we need to do is really now make these new acquisitions grow and consolidate them rather than expand geographically any further. Derived from the focus on Complex Generics and Specialty, I think it is a natural corollary that the R&D investments have to get enhanced in Complex Generics and the Specialty area and also in Biologics and you already see that escalation happening as we will discuss the financials. Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 As far as the execution is concerned, I think we’ve always revered for flawless execution and operational excellence is one of the key drivers of our effort there. We want to make sure that we are cost leaders in whatever we do. And that brings me to sharing with you, what we have been sharing in the past too as to how we see Lupin mopping, from a Generic - Branded Generic Company till now into Complex Generics, Specialty Company going forward and the share of Complex Generics and Specialty has to increase with the Generic component of the business. Generic would always remain a very lion piece of the business, as you know that, at any given time, very large part of illness is served by patent expired drugs. So one cannot do with that but larger attention would be received by Specialty and Complex Generics in our business. So that’s about the trends that we are kind of witnessing in the industry. In the face of those trends, I think its worthwhile looking at how Lupin stacks up to this challenge. I think one feels very proud to share journey of last 10-years with the audience here. It has been a stellar performance by any standards. If you look at the market capitalization, I think, there’s a compounded annual growth rate of 32% from kind of Rs.41 billion to Rs.667 billion. Revenues have registered a growth of 24% in the same period. R&D expenditure has also gone up with 31% growth and this is something which -- you know, R&D is a key driver of our business endeavor in Pharmaceuticals and therefore requisitely we’ve been investing in the priority areas in R&D. What is most heartening is the quality of our business where you see our EBITDA margins growing at annual compounded rate of growth 29%. There were times when we were struggling around the 10% and you know 18-19% for a long time. We’ve crossed that barrier and we are now around 30%. Likewise, net profit also has shown very promising growth of 29%. So that speaks about the way we have organizationally strengthened our company. As a consequence of that, we are today 7th Largest Generic Company Globally by Market Cap, 9th Largest Company by Revenues, we are the Third Largest Indian Pharma Company by Global Sales, #1 Anti-TB Company which is our Legacy business, we are the 5th Largest Company in the United States by Prescriptions; we have a prescription share of 5.6-5.7%, we are the 9th Largest Generic Company in Japan, 8th Largest Indian Pharma Company and the 4th Largest Generic Company in South Africa and #1 Cardiovascular Company in South Africa. With the good work that the team has done, it has brought along the accolades that the team deserves. The notable ones, that I may mention here in the long list that is in front of you, is being designated as Outstanding Company of the Year by CNBC- TV18, Lupin was ranked as “15th Best Place to Work for in Asia” by Great Places to Work Institute, we have been ranked as one of the best employer of 2016 in India by Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 AON. Vinita Gupta and Nilesh were awarded the Entrepreneur of the year award by Ernst & Young. Vinita has been in the focus for various awards, as you can see the list there and I think the notable one has been the Power 50 Women in Business and last but not the least is Ramesh Swaminathan who has been recognized as The Best CFO by FinanceAsia. When we speak about Lupin today and how it stacks up against the trends and the challenges that I shared in the beginning of the presentation, I think what we are doing with our head down as a team in the company, is to build a global footprint for the company, both through the internal development of capabilities as well as acquiring capabilities from the outside through M&A, wherever we feel either the lead times are going to be very long or we just don’t have the wherewithal from within to build those capabilities. And in that regard, you would see here, that we have set up a state-of-the-art R&D facility in Florida for Inhalation, we have our first Biosimilar order for Pune facility getting into Phase-III Etanercept, we had a stellar launch of Glumetza and a lot of positive movement that we are seeing today is because of that and we hope to continue to do launches like that in future too. On the Inorganic side, we used to hold 60% equity in the South African company, is now 100% ours, so we acquired the 40% remaining equity from the erstwhile promoter, we have acquired a business in Brazil Medquimica, we have acquired Gavis which is our largest acquisition and one of the largest out of India, we also acquired a small CNS portfolio in Germany called Temmler. We’ve always said that you know our inorganic play would be not to chase size but to chase quality. And I think that’s what the slide here would show you that of the entire growth story that Lupin has experienced, 20% of our revenue comes out of inorganic endeavors or inorganic interventions and 80% of that is really our organic effort. So that speaks for the team, as to how well integrated they have been, in terms of achieving the kind of target that we had set for ourselves, which have always been very stretched. And I think another highlight of the journey is that whatever we acquire along the way that too has grown extremely well. So if you see Kyowa that we acquired in October 2007 has registered a compounded annual growth rate of 16% on constant foreign exchange. Likewise the South African asset Pharma Dynamics has grown 25% in the period. So, that shows that whatever we acquired has also been producing results and growing at a very healthy clip. Gavis which is now called Lupin Somerset is our biggest and by far the latest acquisition. And while we were kind of endeavoring to have it by mid of last year, but we could close it only towards the early part of this year, but what is important is that performance is on track, the integration is complete, we have a new leader there, who is an extremely competent person and we hope that whatever we have planned, Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 in terms of tripling the turnover of Lupin Somerset from the time of acquisition, we will definitely be hitting the bull’s eye there. What is even more interesting to share with you that in the portfolio of Gavis, we could get to reach for our Branded business. You know that we are very proud of our Branded business, but for various reasons it had been going down because we lost intellectual property rights on a particular product, it became Generic on Suprax, but these two new leads - one on Methergine which is for Women’s Health and other one, you know, methylphenidate chewable tablets for the Pediatric ADHD indication is giving a new lead to our Branded business and also gives us little more time to really push hard in terms of other efforts that we have been making in building that business. I think you are all aware that in terms of net effect of Gavis on Lupin’s portfolio it has added 28 products to our marketed products, so total 124 products are there in the market today. There are 9 controlled substances and 01 dermatology product out of this basket. There are about 102 cumulative filings, of which 58 are pending and additional 66 products are under development. Lupin has a good score in terms of our total filings; now we have filed, between Lupin and Lupin-Somerset that is our new facility, Gavis, 343 filings, of which 180 have been approved and balance are awaiting approval. What has been more heartening, is that we have total 256 products under development between the two facilities. So that should give you an idea as to how the future is going to pan out with this rich pipeline of products which is getting ready, with 163 awaiting approval and 256 getting into the pipeline. We have spoken about our journey. I think we have been continuously traversing this nexus of complexity where our risk will slightly go up but rewards will substantially go up and you know in business where you have risk, you have rewards. And if you see the chart in front of you, you would see that our journey is defined in the chart starting with Oral Contraceptives. On the right hand side of the chart, you see the total market potential that one is trying to address through this effort and on the left you see the various components of this effort that together constitute riding the wave of complexity as far as the business is concerned. Starting with Oral Contraceptives where we have 21 products in the market, 10 are pending approval. Moving on to Ophthalmology, where we have 2 products in the market, 7 filings are awaiting approval and there are more developments happening; Dermatology, as I said a while ago, we have 1 product from Gavis portfolio and 24 filings, further development is ongoing. And on to Controlled Substances, which is again a very cohesive area for business and we started making efforts in Injectables Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 last two years. We acquired a R&D facility in Netherlands in the name of Nanomi and between LRP, that is Pune facility and Nanomi, will be developing a set of Complex Injectables. We set up this R&D for Inhalation in Florida, which has already made 2 filings; 1 MDI is under clinical trial and we hope to commence trial of the DPI device during this year. And then of course we have a Biosimilars program in India, where we have 10 products under development and one of them Etanercept is entering Phase-III for Japan. And of course, we have a program on new drug discovery where we have 10 new chemical entities, 4 of them are in clinical trials currently. Talking about Global Footprint: I think very rightly we have today manufacturing facilities, 12 sites in India, 2 in Japan, 1 in United States, 1 in Mexico and 1 in Brazil. We also have a research facility in Pune in India. Also, a small research facility in Aurangabad to augment the Generic development. We have research facilities in Japan, one for Injectable, one for Oral Solid Dosage. We have R&D facilities in Somerset and we have also small R&D facilities in Mexico and in Brazil and of course Nanomi in Netherlands. So that’s truly the mark of a global footprint where we have multiple manufacturing organization and multiple research facility to really pool into overall effort of moving up the complexity chain and reaching our target that we have set for ourselves. I said in the beginning that the rigor of inspections have gone up from FDA, for good reasons, at the same time, I think -- for example, - last one year we have faced about 12, so -- and there have been times when two sites are being inspected at the same time, so that would just tell you as to how much extra vigilance is happening in - on this count. We have had a very good record as far as compliance is concerned since 2009, but in the recent past, yes, we also face the heat as I mentioned earlier. The major among these observation has been only Goa where we had a repeat inspection from the FDA, we have responded to the observations and we have provided an update thereafter which is kind of in regular good order and we are now working for a holistic transformation. In a matter of speaking, the transformation is never complete here because the goal post keeps changing, so you have to continuously work to keep on the effort and if at all there is any failing, it is our own failing to live up to certain speed of the target changing. From time to time the prescription from the FDA undergo change, the new employees come, the training needs - need to be augmented and therefore there are times when one has challenges to face, but we are very confident that we are going to be able to deal with it like we did it in the past in 2009. So that, kind of gives you a snapshot of how Lupin today stacks up to the trends and the challenges, as are presented to work in the industry. Now, a quick Business Update for you: Ramesh has already shared this with you, you have the results with you I think, Q4 has been an epoch making quarter for us. It is a record turnover of Rs.4,000 crores plus and a record net profit of Rs.800 crores Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 plus. Obviously, this is riding on major contribution from United States apart from other geographies like India and Japan which have also turned out very good performance. In fact, what is heartening about Lupin is that all geographies have turned out good performance, notwithstanding FOREX pressure in the emerging markets where the local currency has been depreciating, but since US is a lion share of our revenue, obviously, what happens in the US affects our overall results rather more penetratingly either in other geographies. In terms of the annual results, as you know that we started off last year, the first two quarters were under challenge. We spoke about the price pressures in America, we spoke about the NLEM effect you know the price reduction there and in face of all that, we never had any new products in the first two quarters, so one of the ways to combat pressures of prices is really to be able to launch new products, but unfortunately, we had pretty dry spell in the first two quarters, it was from Q3 onwards that we started, you know, getting better; we did a reasonable job in the Q3, but Q4 has been fantastic. Overall, the year witnessed a very moderate growth of 8.7 % in the top line. The net profit appears like recording slight decline of 5.5%; however, we maintain the PBT despite a severe hike in our R&D expenditure. As Ramesh was mentioning to you that this 28.8% EBITDA that you see here is, you give cognizance of the Rs.500 crores extra expenditure that we have done in R&D which is again done for the future, so there is no concern on that account because this is all going towards building IP for the future in terms of clinical development product, but just for the sake of a perspective, if that were to not to be spent, the EBITDA margin will be 32.4%, as against 30.6% of previous year, that will all flow into the PBT line. Adding to that with our unsold inventory and the tax paid on that, our tax rate has been 5% higher than previous year. So all that put together, reflects into what you see is the net bottom line of the company. It is not to justify, it is just to share with you some of the real happenings in the business. Now, talking about some of the Major Geographies -- US: The overall business has shown a growth on corresponding quarter as well as on sequential quarters; 54%. And, this is all in dollar terms as you see on your screen. And as I mentioned that because the first two quarters were absolutely dry for a new product and we’ve done a lot of bucking up in the Q3 and Q4, the year ended up in US as flat. However, there have been some remarkable achievements in the US, as you know that Lupin is a supplier of four of the top ten most commonly dispensed products in United States, we are #5 by Prescription in the US, we have a very handsome pipeline of products as we spoke a while ago with 343 ANDA filings, of which, you know, 180 are approved and Somerset facility has substantially added to that particular portfolio. Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 We had 39 approvals during the year, of which 25 were for Lupin and 14 from Lupin Somerset.",

      "content": "Despite all the pressures has grown 6% over the year. It is 9th largest generic company. You know that it’s a strong company in CNS, Cardiovascular, and Gastroenterology. We’re actually building a new dedicated site for Oral Solid Dosage, also there is a new Injectable line coming up in Japan. In Japan, it is material to have a relationship with national distributors, 4 of them, we have recently got into an alliance with one of the national distributors, we only do some business with 2 of them I think we are now trying to expend on our exposure at the national level. This should augur very well for the company in terms of getting a larger share of the distribution piece. In the rest of the businesses also, as I said, Lupin always has this positive side that we are able to have a secular growth in all our markets. And this is even more meaningful here that what you see on the slide that whatever you see here is despite a pressure on the foreign exchange devaluation in most of the emerging markets. South Africa business has grown 10%, it is the Fourth Largest Generic Company as I mentioned earlier and the #1 Cardiovascular Company. Philippines had a fantastic record of growth of 42% as against industry growth of 9% and is ranked 22nd. Latin America- our Mexican company Lab Grin is the 2nd Largest Ophthal Company by Volume but the 4th largest by revenue. And Brazil, which is Medquimica, is rather new in our system, so we have just to see as to how it mops up, we obviously have plans to grow that business. Europe did well this time; Hormosan, which had been giving us some concerns at times was rather going up and down, we definitely see very clear signs of turning around, it’s now making profit and as I mentioned earlier, Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 we also have acquired a company Temmler which adds to the CNS portfolio of Germany. API business is the strong pillar for Lupin because it feeds all our formulation endeavors. We’ve had a certain slowness in the growth because we have an old portfolio but a lot of new initiatives have been taken in API in terms of adding new line of therapy, new line of APIs, those are going to mop over next two to three years. What is even more heartening that now the API business is going to participate in advanced markets, as you see here, there are 172 US DMF filings, 16 of which were made in this particular year and once they come up, you obviously see a high quality business being added to this portfolio, so that should augur extremely well for the API business of the company. I think we have spoken about R&D that as we move up the complexity curve, I think there is little choice, but to put in more money in R&D, because as you get into the world of Complex Generics and Specialty, Biosimilars, New Drug Discovery of course, there is a lot more clinical development that we have to do and that takes in a lot of money. So as you would see that over last year -- in this year- our R&D expense has gone up by 3%. Just in Q4, the R&D investment was 12.5% of our sales, but you also saw the pipeline that we are developing for future and it takes all that to really be able to bring that to reality. At the same time, I think one is very conscious of the fact that when we are investing in R&D, we need to make sure that our research pipeline really delivers. We continue to invest a lot of money and time in building a good pool of people in addition to what we have in India, as you know now, we have also very strong R&D in United States and the other geographies, where we today have acquired businesses. We’ve already shared the pipeline, so I’m not going to repeat that here. So, having looked at the industry trends, having shared with you as to how does Lupin stack up to those trends, then a quick pen picture of how the financials have come through over the time is now you know - is now to leave you with what are we going to be doing in the company and you see some of the key buckets here for our future endeavors. Very clearly, in Generics, I think we have to grow US and Japan by new launches and grow base business, increase penetration in emerging markets, that’s very clearly the objective. When it comes to Specialty, we have to continue and reinforce our effort to build Specialty both organically as well as inorganically and we are in the process of building a Specialty pipeline. As far as R&D is concerned, I think the task is cut out because in Pharmaceuticals business there are two drivers - key drivers of the business. I sometimes like to add the third one. The R&D on one hand, Marketing the second and maybe Operational Excellence which becomes overriding, rest everything else is a Service function if you really look at Pharma. So R&D is a Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 lifeline of our business and we will continue to deliver on the pipeline and we will evolve the Complex Generics and Specialty pipeline over time, the effort has already started showing up, you will see that in coming quarters. I said that a while ago Operational Excellence, Cost Leadership, High Efficiency, Optimal Time Cycles is the order of the day. You have to remain lean and I think that’s what our endeavor is as far as operational excellence is concerned. Compliance is going to remain a major challenge in our business and we all understand that if you’ve hooked for non- compliance, what it can cost you and therefore that would always remain an area of high interest. With that, I come to an end of my presentation. Thank you very much. I think we can now take questions and we will deal with the questions as they come. Do you have some? Okay, Alpesh is saying that we will have questions from the live audience and alternatively also with the connected audience.",

      "content": "Yes, so a good part of the growth for the fiscal year ’17 is Glumetza, the product that we just launched, we see significant upside in fiscal year ’17, Fortamet, again, should be a significant contributor to fiscal year ’17, both products we expect limited number of competitors, Fortamet, we have one of two right now and we think over the next 12-months - 24 months we probably see one or two additional competitors, likewise for Glumetza, we see two competitors coming in after our six-month exclusivity is up in August, but we still think it would be a sizeable opportunity for us and as the rest of the industry. So good part of growth for fiscal year ’17 is our existing portfolio and then the new product, we certainly are looking forward to new product approvals despite our challenges at Goa, we hope to be able to resolve the 483 with FDA. Proactively we have started tech transferring the materials products that we expect to launch in fiscal year ’17 to our other approved sites to Indore to Aurangabad and to Somerset. Then, we go through the Gavis portfolio, then we have a very nice site - Generic portfolio that we have added in March with the acquisition of Gavis, we see the potential of expanding share on the Generic side of the portfolio, Gavis had a reasonable share but we have stronger reach, stronger relationship with the customers, that should enable us to expand share. And lastly, the growth on the Brand side of the business, the last year - last -- last year was really challenging for our Brand business, we saw Generic Suprax right at the start of the year - you know in April that for us our whole Brand business down significantly to $45 million this last year. When this year with the restructuring of our commercial infrastructure plus the addition of two products - our Gavis and particular Methergine - we see the Brand business getting back to a reasonable level of revenues. We had two products as Dr. Sharma mentioned Methergine and chewable Methylphenidate that Gavis was sole source on that we believe could benefit from promotion. So, we took our sales force 120 people from Pediatric, Primary Care split to Pediatric Women’s Health and Primary Care and have started calling on the hospitals of kinds with Methergine, and they have got very good initial response. Likewise, we added Methylphenidate, chewable Methylphenidate source on to the Brand side, the Pediatric portfolio and have started promoting in and again we started seeing a ramp up scripts with chewable Methylphenidate. So really I mean a lot of our growth focus is the products that we have launched in the last year, the products that we have acquired and there is opportunity on the Brand side of the business that we leverage out of the Gavis portfolio and new products additions out of India as well as of Somerset.",

As you would have seen from the results, the performance in the quarter has been good. We have done better than last quarter on a sequential basis. The top-line has seen a growth of 2% and the bottom-line, interestingly, has seen an improvement of 27%, -- although there is a decline of 8% on the revenue line on the corresponding basis and a 31% decline on the on the profit, which is in line with what we had been indicating earlier that there is a pressure on business in the U.S., primarily on account of consolidation of the trade partners and price reductions. But what is heartening about Lupin is that we have shown a very good growth in other segments of our business. As you know, US of course is a major driver of our profit and growth because it is about 35%. But India, which is about 30% of our revenues, has shown a growth of 24%. EMEA, again, has recorded a very good performance at about 22%-23%. APAC, likewise, has shown a growth of about 6% or so. So thats something very characteristic about Lupin that only in the market in US where there is a general sense of overall, kind of, I would say, headwinds in terms of business that we have been under pressure. Otherwise, in every other segment of our business, we have done very well. And also, I think what is interesting and what is noteworthy is that our operational efficiencies have been improving and there is a concerted effort to get them on track and even better. As you would notice from manufacturing expenses which have gone down and also from R&D investment that we have been calibrating, in no way we are sacrificing on any of our projects, but we have been calibrating our expenses and making sure that we do not exceed what we have intended to do. Having said that, I think we continue to work on our strategy to implement a growth path on complex generics, biosimilars and specialty. You will hear a lot more from Vinita on our forays in specialty that we have been building on and we are committed to build it further. With that, I will hand over the call to Ramesh to give you a financial pen picture for the business and then we will open the floor for Q&A. Thank you very much.",

So really we are round the corner from realizing returns from these investments with our first biosimilar, first inhalation product coming to market.

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Sharma. Good afternoon, friends. Welcome to the Q3’ FY20 earnings call. Like Dr. Sharma spoke of, I would first want to address the 2 exceptional items that you see presented in the results and in the PR. I would explain each of these and then go to the normalized operational results for better clarity. Firstly, we had the Kyowa divestiture that was announced in November and finally, completion of the transaction took place on December 17. We see in the books, a one-time pretax accounting gain of Rs, 1,291 crores. Against this there were taxes, and the net amount of gain that you see is Rs. 997 crores for the quarter, which is a one-off item. The second exceptional item that you see in the numbers is the impairment of the Gavis intangibles. Certain IPs of the Gavis portfolio were reevaluated looking at the U.S. market conditions, and we have decided to take a provision for impairment. The amount is Rs.1,579 crore, roughly about US$ 228 million on the pretax line. Linked to this, there were certain deferred tax assets, which we also decided to reverse in relation to the Gavis transaction. So total impairment was US$ 288 million. The tax line contains a charge of about Rs. 405 crore and the total impairment, therefore, we have taken is about Rs.1,958 crores on account of the Gavis transaction. Im sure you would have questions on the tax line, which clearly shows that theres almost Rs. 700 crores one-off thats lying in the reported numbers. Lupin Limited February 06, 2020 Dr. Sharma has talked about the benefits of it. I would just like to say that with the Kyowa proceeds, we would be acting on deleveraging our balance sheet. The Gavis impairment improves our PBT. It positively impacts our tax rate, ETR. Also, the lightening of balance sheet on account of both these events improves the ROCE by close to 300 basis points. Moving on to the operational highlights. The results that you see for Q3 have been restated for Kyowa. All the results that you see are as per the Ind AS standards on a comparable basis, except where in the PR, we may have specified thats not the case. Sales for the quarter came in at Rs. 3,716 crores. This was 1.1% up versus the previous quarter and on a YTD basis, you see a y-o- y growth of 8%. Gross margins came in at 63.4%. Like we discussed before, its flat and also shown an improvement vis-à-vis the previous year by about 0.7%. EBITDA margin came in at 14.1% versus the previous quarter EBITDA margin of around 17.1%. This was impacted by lumpiness in expenses on account of sales promotion, a slight uptick in R&D investments as well as some of the remediation activities that are ongoing. The YTD EBITDA number has come in at 18.5%. We expect the Q4 number to be higher than the Q3 number. So eventually, for the FY 20, we should be at the lower range of the 18%-20%, expectation that we set during the course of this year. Those were the key highlights, and I would now like to open the floor for questions.",

Obviously, we are working very closely with the agency to make that happen. You mentioned facility, of course, is make or break. We are very cognizant of that as well. But as we look at some of these areas right now in the near term, you look at inhalation, which is important part of our growth driver in the next couple of years. And specifically look at the product filings, whether its albuterol in the U.S., Fostair in Europe, Spiriva in the U.S. and the facilities they are from like Pithampur Unit 3, which has gone through FDA inspection, gone through European inspections, and we feel good about the ability to get approved for these products and supply out of there. Likewise, on the biosimilars front, which, again, is a material growth driver in the next couple of years, we have received approval in Japan, we have received approval in Australia. Expect that we should be able to get product approval also in Europe and then U.S., of course, for pegfilgrastim and other products in the future. Over the last couple of years, there have been a lot of learnings along the way. As we get closer to this point, we feel good about our ability to be able to monetize this investment and this pipeline over the next few years.",

But yes, like we said, this quarter has got lumpiness on account of both sales promotion, higher sales promotion activity in some of the branded generic markets and a higher investment in R&D and the one-offs on the remediation, which we believe will go away in the near future. So Rs.1,240 crores is not the number, which is a reference point. It is Rs.1,200 crores, it would be lower",

In terms of the financials, results are already with you, but let me take you through this again. Sales at Rs.3,791 crores for Q4as compared to Rs.3,716 crores for the previous quarter, which actually represents a 2% growth. It’s flat as compared to Q4 of 2019. US, our most important market, grew 14% sequentially, US $212 million as compared to US$186 million in the previous quarter. Though, there has been a decline vis-à-vis Q4 of last year, and that you would recognize is essentially because of gRanexa. In terms of the full year, US sales were close to US$800 million vis-à-vis us$777 million in FY19, a growth of about 3%.India region saw a growth of 15% vis-à-vis Q4 of last year., You would also recognize that Q4 is always the weakest quarter in the year and that’s why you see a decline sequentially. India region grew about 12.7%, on a full year basis EMEA, did very well. It grew 25.3% sequentially and 7% yoy. Growth was particularly strong in South Africa. Gross margins for this quarter was 62.9% vis-à-vis 63.4%.in the previous quarter Friends, you would recognize that this is essentially a sales mix issue. In terms of the comparison with the previous year, it’s down from 68.9%, essentially because last year we had a large component coming in from Ranolazine sales in the base itself. Lupin Limited May 29, 2020 During this quarter there was favorable US dollar gains vis-à-vis the rupee, but unfortunately, it’s been negated by Forex in South Africa and Brazil. In terms of EBITDA margins, we delivered improvement in operational profitability on a sequential basis, which is 19.4%, which is 530 basis points increase vis-à-vis the previous quarter. We closed the full year at an EBIDTA margin of 18.7%, which is within the expected range of 18% to 20%. Sequentially it is higher because of lower R&D and sales promotion spends and also due to forex gains. In terms of ETR, we’ve done fairly well. Though for the full year, it’s still hovering around the 40% mark, but going forward we expect it to certainly go down. This is evident even in this particular quarter. For the full year next year, it should be around the mid 30’s mark. This year we did a lot of things in terms of the balance sheet restructuring. We undertook significant measures, in terms of optimizing our capital allocation and worked towards normalizing our ETR, which for various reasons has been higher than the standard. We divested our Japanese operations and undertook an impairment of the Gavis acquisition to strengthen our balance sheet. We believe that all of this would certainly result in better ratios over time. We used the divestiture of Kyowa to repay a large portion of the debt. The debt-equity ratio is favorable standing at around 0.12. We’re very well-positioned for better performance in the quarters to come. But for sure there is this overhang of COVID at least in the first quarter.",

      "content": "Yes, there was a significant impact of COVID on the OTC specialty per se as well as on Solosec. We saw really the OB/GYN clinic visits come down to 20% level pre-COVID, and only for critical conditions. From Q3, we had started to see a good ramp up into Q4 in January, and in February we started to see the COVID impact, which impacted the scrips which we have seen Lupin Limited May 29, 2020 down to almost 45% pre-COVID levels at the lowest. In the last 4 weeks we have started to see this stabilize. In April, we saw the scrip levels hit the bottom and since then weve seen it grow slowly. However, we have taken some significant measures to optimize that business. We had realized that Solosec is going to be a slower build, it had consistent growth but still at a slower level. Pre-COVID we just saw a strong reception to virtual calls, and doctor coverages through telehealth and taking virtual calls as opposed to the face-to-face interaction. We have really restructured our operating model going forward, to a higher level of virtual investment, and very significantly reduced our operating spend and burn rate nearly by 50%. We downsized the field team in the last couple of weeks to be able to really reduce that burn. So now having restructured the team, plus having the same focus on a different mix of virtual versus face-to-face interaction, starting to see scrip ramp up from the low of April. The recent wins that we had through the Solosec was put on preferred position by ESI couple of weeks ago. We also had very positive readout of trichomoniasis study to expand the use of Solosec. We feel pretty good about growing the business at a burn rate that we can sustain while Solosec grows.",

There certainly is heightened sensitivity around that. I think its a real crisis, which is going on in India right now. Obviously, were seeing a very grim situation.

But Id say that your point was correct that the investment was front-loaded on the complex generics on all our platforms, whether it is inhalation, complex injectables, biosimilars. It took time to establish them. It took time to establish capabilities. It took time to really get the pipeline together, but we are starting to see the results of it. As we look now, at the inhalation portfolio paying off. We will see in the next couple of years, the ramp up of the inhalation portfolio business. Then the injectables will start contributing. We now have a very solid portfolio on the injectables front, with depot injectables, peptides, iron products and liposomal products through a partnership. So, that will start contributing in the next two to three years. Biosimilars started contributing ex-US with Etanercept. In the next couple of years, we would start seeing contribution of products like Pegfilgrastim and then Ranibizumab and beyond. As we look at return over the next five years, the complex generics are our biggest growth drivers when we look at our five-year plan - revenues and also margins. Overall, your question on R&D investment, as Ramesh said at the beginning of the call, that we have managed to keep our R&D investment under control. We were over 10% two years ago. We were at the 9% level in this past year. It will continue to decline as a percentage of sales, while our R&D investment continues to increase YoY, just given our revenue potential is also pretty strong now going forward. I hope that answers your question.",

But when we look at R&D spend, we look at these three areas and granted that specialty is not R&D spend, its more a commercial spend, but investment in areas that our peers dont have for the most part. Really trying to find more creative ways to be able to bring in additional partners - financing partners to be able to mitigate the risk, spend and burn on the company P&L overall, but still have the ability to grow these areas effectively. Make the right investments from portfolio standpoint is the reason why were looking at all three areas. Thats not to say that we will necessarily do each, but we are exploring each to see what’s the best way is to maximize value for the company by mitigating the P&L.",

Youll see the saliency of the US going back up, and the saliency of India coming down correspondingly in that. I think the saliency is also reflective of the one-time NCE Income. When you take that out of the constituent set, the percentages change. These two are our big markets. I think for the US, the focus very much has been on R&D, and capacities, the pipeline to deliver for that. That focus continues. Weve brought in a lot more focus in India. Firstly, on manufacturing where we added facilities like Sikkim which weve completely scaled up. But I think we havent done a great job of pipeline in India. I think weve done a fantastic job of partnering a pipeline to bring in India, but I dont think weve done a great job of building a pipeline. That is where the focus is, that was also one of the key result areas for last year. We now have more than 20 products in development. At least four of them will come to market this fiscal and we should have 10-12 kind of unique products coming from our own stable into the Indian market next year on. I think these will obviously be a meaningful growth driver. Doesnt change the story from still getting access to in-license products and the like, but there is a significant investment, which is being made for even some of the new age COVID products. Other than that, just products that would fit into the respiratory space, into the cardiovascular space, into the diabetes space.",

We also have a follow-on for pegfilgrastim, the Onpro biosimilar. Were going to have both pegfilgrastim as well as the Onpro biosimilar. Theres going to be a timing gap. We will assess whether it make sense to try to club them together to be able to leverage the commercial investment or launch pegfilgrastim ahead of the on-body product. We hope that we have the opportunity to launch next fiscal year. Like Nilesh mentioned, its going to depend on the inspection. The agency has already informed us that they will have to inspect the site. Well wait for that milestone to pass and then determine the right timing to set up commercial infrastructure. October 28, 2021 Ill also say that the commercial infrastructure for biosimilars has synergies with our injectables institutional portfolio. We are simultaneously building our injectables portfolio as well, both internally through our pipeline as well as through partnerships, through in-licensing.

Certainly, we see the reason to moderate in the U.S. Vinita already talked about specialty. But even on the generic side, you can see that the R&D investment is coming down. The intention would be to keep it there, focused on the complex generics and biosimilars. We believe that those are incredible growth opportunities. We believe that the capital that we allocate to the generic business in the U.S. has to come down, and we are taking the right steps towards that. A small portion of that will go into investing into markets like India, whether its R&D or manufacturing. I think there is a very conscious capital allocation change, which is happening. There was a period where we were very heavily weighted towards generics in the U.S., that is moderating a little bit and bringing back more focus to India and in terms of also maximizing our portfolio globally.

From that perspective, the endeavor on a lot of the organic part is on the complex and differentiated products. We would be calibrated in terms of our evaluation of the risk itself and where we believe the risk is very high, we would partner with the financial partners, taking away the risk element from the overall risk score itself. And if your question is directed towards M&A. Weve learned our lesson and to that extent, any aggression on that score would be very heavily debated and we would view it accordingly. On the newer ones that I think have been raised in this call, diagnostics and digital, the factors, as Nilesh very clearly articulated, its going to be baby steps in that direction. The major theme is going to be on the existing business itself. We would take a very calibrated approach in the way we allocate capital towards that and watch out for returns before we start investing more in that.",

      "content": "Thank you. Dr. Sharma and good evening, friends. Trust you and your family are keeping good in these troubled times. Revenue for Lupin grew 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven primarily by U.S growth of 10.4%, driven in turn by, strong growth of albuterol, where we now have a 20% market share. Year-on-year, we registered 4.3% growth, driven by majority of our markets, U.S. 9%, and IRF 12% (overall India region 8%), along with others like Australia 13%. Gross margins were down by 0.9% QoQ primarily due to increase in the input material cost, sales mix, and higher U.S. sales. Employee cost is down 2%, quarter-on-quarter at 18.2% of net sales, primarily due to the savings realized, with the specialty restructuring in the U.S.. This despite providing for additional sales incentives in India linked to performance. Manufacturing and other expenses were higher by 18.3%, quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to the one-time charge of about $26 million or INR193 crores. We reviewed U.S. provisions and determined that there was a need to further increase the same, to properly reflect the impact of some one-time items, that we experienced over the last two years. That is the unusual high volumes returns from a 2020 patient level recall of Metformin and slow-moving flu medication at wholesalers’ warehouses. Other income is down 53%, primarily due to interest on tax refund, earned in quarter two, and this is obviously not there in quarter three. EBITDA adjusted for the one-time charge of $26 million or INR193 crores, was at INR564 crores flat quarter- on- quarter. The adjusted EBITDA of 13.7% versus 14.1% sequentially. Given the exceptional items taken at Lupin standalone accounts, the bottom line for the first nine-months comes up negative, warranting a write back of the taxes provided till date. The ETR for the full year, for the company should be about 30% to 32%. Given the tax being paid in certain geographies, despite the lower PBT on a consolidated basis. For the next two to three quarters, we see margin slowly moving up in the 14% levels. The next couple of quarters, EBIDTA improvement will come largely from the optimization efforts and there are several initiatives in advanced stages, including tight management of FTS, our returns, write-offs, freight charges and plant idle cost. Some of the near-term drivers of February 4, 2022 growth, are going to be Suprep, Peg G-CSF, Tiotropium and growth in India and other geographies. We see meaningful uptick in H2 FY23 and then FY24, we see the real growth drivers kicking in, with full impact of our inhalations’ portfolio, injectables’ portfolio, and biosimilars which will deliver higher numbers and commensurate gain to the margins and EBITDA levels to move up to about 20% plus. Friends would also be happy to know that, we have completed our acquisition of a Bolt-on in Australia, called the Southern Cross. And further add the numbers going forward, Ill tell you the full story and other issues, I would open the floor for discussions. With this, may I open the floor for the discussions.",

I think we have invested in more platforms that have yet to deliver. I mean whether it is the, I mean, so inhalational is started to, injectables has yet to, biosimilars has yet to in the material manner, specialty obviously we optimized, NCE we want to spin out. But right now the investment is, the number is within our R&D spent. So, Id say higher R&D spend and as Ramesh said also, high investments in facilities, some of which again for these products for the future, but some idle cost that has gathered over time that due to new product launches not happening due to our OAI warning letter status. So, that portion, we are correcting, of course, but as we continue to really launch a product from the new February 4, 2022 platforms and our optimization efforts, when we look at FY24 for example, when we have Albuterol, Tiotropium, Pegfilgrastim, few products are not just one or two, but three, four products, five products on the complex front in the market. We really see both from a revenue and gross margin pricing standpoint that upside as well as capacity utilization standpoint operating leverage.",

      "content": "Now, its been four years since I last met with investors from Lupin. So I was really looking forward to meeting with you today. I hope you and your relatives, your family have been keeping safe during this time. The last couple of years have been pretty bad for a lot of families. I hope you have been doing good. Of course, I have been in touch with people about our performance. Youve been posing questions to me from time to time. And of course, we have had our regular investor calls like every quarter and you have already supported us, guided us, assisted us and we should be looking at things and so on. Thank you for that. Again, coming back to the current year performance, happy to take you through our quarterly performance as well as our results for the year itself. Its a smaller crowd out here, but Im sure there are lot of people who are on the call itself, who would potentially be asking us questions because as per the SEBI regulation, I think we need to be live for the rest of the community to interact with us. So I really would be looking forward to questions from those people who are online, so to speak. And Im happy to take this again. So, well begin with the presentation. So, this is our strategic vision. Next slide, please. Go on to the slide after that. This is our strategic vision for us as a company: a global pharma company focused on core growth platforms. As you recognize, we have done extremely well in India over time. As I listened to a lot of you, you have also been telling me that you should really be focusing on India. And just about a few minutes ago, it was very surprising because sort of people are telling me, as I was listening to them, that India is -- your valuation has been captured in India per se, and the rest of the business has not actually been valued. And to that extent, it is surprising in some ways. Im sure there are going to be a lot of questions about some of the parts and how we could take this forward, so theyre talking to me about that. And so we are looking at India very, very seriously, both organic and inorganic growth. And as weve recognized, weve done a stupendous job out here. And we just acquired recently Anglo-French because thats the way forward for a host of products in the years to come as well. As with a lot of other pharma companies, we are also acquiring assets and focusing on a lot of -- number of platforms. So a lot of complex, really complex ones. I spoke about it a few minutes ago also about the fact that we are concentrating so much on complex injectables, on our inhalations portfolio. And let me add biosimilars. And the fact that OSD business is not going to be the focus area. And thats resonated with you as well. From a global perspective, we believe that we need to be absolutely focused on efficiency. There are number of initiatives that we are taking to make ourselves a lot more efficient because there has been tremendous inefficiencies that have crept into the system over the last few years. But we are conscious of that, and were taking all steps to kind of work on that. May 19, 2022 We are also building operating leverage in our CapEx spend, as well as on R&D. Of course, the overall focus would be to really focus on product development cycles for development and to kind of compress that so that we are delivering top-notch launches from time to time. So, it actually helps in leveraging our top line, a continuous improvement culture, sentient culture, if you may. And of course, the global quality class. All of these, of course, are initiatives that weve taken and were really going to focus on. You would like to add to that, Vinita, if you may?",

As youve seen in the last year, weve pretty much taken the specialty burn off in the organization. Likewise, we have efforts underway to take areas like chemical entity where, again, we have established tremendous capability, but it does not really give us operating leverage in our current business, does not get valued in our current business, so finding the right path for those platforms are all efforts that are underway to really focus on these 3 core pillars of growth for the organization, which is doubling down in India, delivering on our complex generics platform and globalizing our complex generics platform. When you look at our platforms like inhalation products, like biosimilars, like complex injectables, unlike the oral solid dosage business, these are global platforms. With the investment that were making both in the pipeline and as well as with building capacities, it may cost us possibly ourselves so that we can, from an economic standpoint, get the end-to- end benefit.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. So, this is about the industry trends. Youve also noticed that price erosion seems to have become endemic and so far as the American business is concerned. And we spoke about it just about a few minutes ago. In January, in particular, for example, we saw a 7% decline, whilst it accelerated to 16%. You cant obviously take one brush and kind of paint everything across the entire landscape. But the fact is there is -- its really going to be product specific, portfolio specific, but it is there to stay. The second thing that seems to be confronting everybody is secular inflation, inflationary trends across all sectors, across the pharmaceutical sector as well. This obviously puts pressure on our overall margins. And thus, obviously have been perhaps, again, there is tremendous need for looking at low intensity competitive launches. And many times I just spoke about the fact that were going to focus on, in fact, inhalations portfolio, the complex injectables, the biosimilars and possibly even on the OSDs, niche launches, not actually capture what do you think is going to be value for customers as well as for our investors. India business will remain strong. Its always been our focus for several years, and you have seen us grow in strength from time to time. It will certainly be extremely important for us May 19, 2022 going forward as well. So, it will be -- it will encompass both organic as well as inorganic strokes. And the good thing about getting out of Covid is the fact that the FDA would begin worldwide inspections. And with that, it could be a double-edge sword. It could work in our favor because we have a pretty decent pipeline stuck without approvals. But it could also turn to be a double-edge sword and that it could also intensify competition, so to speak. This is where Lupin is today from a market cap perspective. Next slide, please. Its about $4 billion market cap and revenue base is about $2.2 billion, EBITDA about $311 million. People are very familiar with this. Globally, we are the 10th largest generic company. We were higher up the league tables a few years ago, and we are sure we will get back there. The sixth largest Indian pharma company, the third largest in American from a prescriptions perspective. And we are present in several geographies from U.S.A., Mexico, Brazil, India, and we are present in Australia, Philippines, South Africa and a host of other places. Our overall manufacturing footprint is about -- weve got about 15 sites spread across India. And of course, we have plants in America, in Brazil and Mexico. And we have 7 R&D sites, again, across various parts of the globe. Next slide, please. This is a snapshot of what we actually -- how we -- Q4 actually was for us. As you can see, if you look at our performance over the last four quarters, it generally has been ranging between INR3,800 crores and INR4,000 odd crores. Q4, there was actually a decline versus Q3. This was led by, in fact, a slight reduction in India and of course, reduction in America. The reasons for decline in India is because Q4, in a general sense, is always the weakest quarter for India market. You know that traditionally, Q1 and Q2 are very strong for India. Q3 and Q4 are a little tepid in comparison. This time around America, so we -- a number of people raised this question to me in the morning, why have we reached less than $200 million because thats what you had guided for at the beginning of this year in America. But the fact is there has been price decline. This quarter, we were also stuck with, in fact, some one- times. So, in terms of losartan, we had our recall - were not able to sell and that actually -- the turnover and also the fact that there were returns associated with, in fact, the recall itself. So together -- and there was a price decline across a number of products because Brovana, we ran out of exclusivity status also. Levothyroxine and others, there were some -- there was a price reduction. So to that extent, you would also appreciate that the acute therapy range that we have in our portfolio, unfortunately, in the last two years to three years, we have not been able to make a whole lot because acute therapy has not been selling in America or in fact, in most parts of the globe. Then, of course, we talk about other therapy areas, including other SBUs, including API, who still have an issue in terms of acute therapy products, cephalosporins products. So, all of this has taken a toll and to that extent, Q4 has remained a little suppressed, so to speak. And if you look at the EBITDA margin, it has also come down. Theres close to INR127 crores impact only because of the fact that our sales were lower. But apart from that, there was, of course, the impact of several one-times. This is including the losartan recall and the costs associated May 19, 2022 with that. As you might also know, we lost our litigation for Solosec in terms of royalties we paid to the vendor and there were associated litigation costs and the like. So, all this actually took a toll. So, the one-time that actually comes into overall expenditure base. Apart from that, there was a swing from the last quarter because last quarter, there were settlement incomes, and those did not figure in this quarter. So actually, the swing is a little more marked in terms of -- its been a -- this big swing vis-à-vis in the previous quarter. The last was 13.7% on a normalized basis. This time, it came down because the sale as well as the one-times that we took, plus, of course. There were other developments, which are very noteworthy and important. We acquired Anglo-French. It was actually consummated in the first week of April, but important development, obviously. We also expanded -- we had a bolt-on acquisition in Australia, a very important one for us. We announced partnerships, strategic partnerships in China and then, of course, supply arrangements in China again and for other important products for Peg G-CSF and so on. You see the FDA approval for a number of products, 3 products as such. And of course, we had our inspection of our Tarapur facility last quarter. Next slide, please. Vinita, this is really your -- would you like to speak about America?",

On the EU5, for example, we also -- Fostair was introduced, and we have been ramping up on NaMuscla as well. Australia, we made this acquisition, Southern Cross, which we believe would serve us good in the years to come. South Africa, now the fourth largest generics player, and of course, been a market leader in cardiovascular space for quite some time. Brazil -- so thats been a loss-making unit until very recently, but its turning around pretty nicely for us. Mexico, we are market leader in ophthalmology, number two actually, Sophia is number one. But in terms of values and then in developing a national footprint, we really are going the full hog out there. And of course, API business -- our fortunes have dipped this year essentially because of acute therapy products not selling in most parts. But I understand the JV business continues to do pretty well. Some headwinds in India on the TB front, but overall, still good growth. And as you might know, we are looking at getting kind of broad-basing our overall portfolio of products that we serve for the global institutional business. Next slide, please. The P&L, essentially, this is a snapshot. This was actually provided previously. We spoke about the fact that there has been a slight decline in overall sales. And we also spoke about the reason why there was a decline in overall EBITDA margins. And there are, of course, exceptional items from a write-off perspective also. This time around, we had accelerated amortization of certain intangibles in Gavis, which we took this year. And overall, given the fact that we actually had a huge exceptional items in Q3. We had -- we ended up with the entire year at an overall loss situation. But just to add, that the next two quarters could potentially be -- might have the same lackluster feeling. But the second half of next year onwards, you would actually see a step up in terms of sales, as well as in terms of the margins that go with it. As Vinita was saying, there are a number of products that we are looking at for America over the next several years. And for sure, I think this would begin in Q3 with Suprep and thats something which we already have an approval for. This is again a snapshot of what we spoke May 19, 2022 about. Essentially, the annualization of our annual results for the year, for the company. And I guess its something that we just spoke about in terms of the exceptional items, making this a very exceptional year in some ways. Next slide, please. Yes. R&D, as you can see, its been running steady at around INR350 crores, INR375 crores mark, so to speak, and now its around the 8% mark. But more importantly, the character of R&D is shifting. As Vinita was also saying, it is going to be more -- a lot more focus on complex generics, so its going to be inhalations and the injectables and biologics all the way -- biosimilars all the way. And of course, the salience of NCE would certainly come down over time. Theres been a tight rein on overall capital expenditure. As you can see, we used to -- it used to be in the INR1,800 crores range. Its hovering around the INR600 crores mark, but theres a lot of impetuses on reining in the CapEx cost expenditure outlays. And of course, from being a cash surplus company, there is a slight increase in overall debts. Theres tremendous scope for potentially working on working capital optimization. Its around 145 days currently, and we and my team are working on optimizing on that. It turned out to be a debt situationally because the fact that we had to pay up the settlements related to Glumetza, but that is one- time. Its a question of time if we kind of get back into the surplus situation until we actually start using it for productive purposes, including M&A. And thats something that we are saying, youll be looking at in India and worthwhile acquisitions in other parts also. Next slide, please. Really, your slide, Vinita. If you want to talk about complex generics, youre passionate about it.",

So, in terms of the revenue split right now, I mean, obviously, its all Etanercept and its small. And its going to be all ex U.S. right now. In the next year, as we launch pegfilgrastim, well see a material shift to the US. And as we have ranibizumab as well, I mean, if I look at ranibizumab, its 50-50 between the U.S. and Europe in terms of market opportunity, but we have a bigger opportunity in the U.S., just given that the customer -- the channels are very similar to the folks that we have established relationships with; the ophthalmic, specialty channel, for example, through our wholesaler relationships is what we will be able to leverage for a product like ranibizumab or a product like Eylea.

And we have taken this as an opportunity to get closer to the business, both Nilesh and myself. We have a very strong Head of Commercial in the U.S., who started the U.S. business, who will lead the P&L from a U.S. perspective. We felt the need and had already started a search for a Chief Scientific Officer for organization with a number of platforms that we have. Our biggest unleash for the organization is our pipeline delivery and platform performance, for which we identify the need of a very strong Chief Scientific Officer. So, we have a search ongoing for it. We have an Interim Head of R&D, Interim CSO, our Head of Portfolio and Pipeline. Sofia Mumtaz is our Interim Chief Scientific Officer. And weve also created a very high-powered -- not high powered, in terms of level in terms of leadership, but a very strong project management office that reports into Nilesh and myself to map and to track all products from product selection to development, to filing and launch to ensure that we get the most out of our R&D investment. So multiple changes there on the -- related to the U.S. business that I felt was -- would be good to share with you.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr Sharma. Friends, in our previous investor call, after the Q4 results, we did guide for a fact that the results for the first two or three quarters could be a little muted, so in line with that, the actual results for the quarter were in line with expectations in that sense. Sales for Q1 FY23 are at INR 3,604 crores as compared to INR 3,864 crores in Q4 FY22. Its a 6.7% quarter-on-quarter decline and year-on-year basis, also declined by 14.9% as compared to Q1 FY22. Our sales excluding the US revenues were higher by 5.9% sequentially and 2.5% year-on-year. When it comes to the US business, during the quarter, the US sales took a significant dip of 33% from $181 million in Q4 FY22 to $121 million in Q1 FY23 as the company took certain strategic decisions to pave the way for building sustainable and profitable business in the US. Firstly, the last few years we have been experiencing huge stock returns on account of higher inventory levels in the trade. During the quarter, we ensured that the inventory levels across our key products are brought down at normalized levels, creating a significant impact in the quarterly sales. The pricing erosion in FY22 has brought down the margins of certain products to single digit to negative territory. The company decided to discontinue some of these products with low and negative margins, which impacted our sales. However, it equally gave us an opportunity to optimize workforce in manufacturing plant in India, the benefits of which will start to flow in the next quarter. We continue to witness double-digit price erosion in this quarter as well coupled with shelf stock adjustment on the higher trade inventory creating a August 4, 2022 dent to the quarter numbers. While surprising erosion can be off set through new launches which we expect to come through in H2 FY23, the first two initiatives have impacted the quarter, but will help us to build focus on building a strong and profitable portfolio in the long run. We continue to build albuterol market share, which improved to 23.2% in Q1 vis-a-vis 22.8% in the previous quarter. Turning to the India business, India branded formulations business posted a growth of 9.9% in Q1 FY23 versus Q4 FY22 though declined on year-on-year basis by 2.9%, given FY22 Q1 had a positive impact on COVID wave 2 in India. API, recovery in API sales in Q1 quarter-on-quarter sales growth at 15.8%. On year-on-year basis, business posted a growth of 3.7%. EMEA year-on-year growth of 27.6% with strong performance by NaMuscula, Luforbec, etanercept sales to Mylan. NaMuscula growth is about 91% versus the previous year, quarter one that is. Sales for Q1 FY23 sales was INR 24.5 crores. In South Africa, Efferflu C holds 48% market share, up from 31% held pre- COVID. When you talk about the growth markets, Philippines year-on-year basis growth 20% with TB kits sales impacting about 9% approximately, better performance in Furic and Lupimet. In Australia, sales grew by 22.4% quarter- on-quarter and year-on-year by 49%, mainly due to the acquisition by Southern Cross. In Mexico, sales grew by 15.9% quarter-on-quarter and year- on-year growth was 30% as ophthal business continues to grow at 26%. In Brazil, quarter-on-quarter declined by 9.5%, year-on-year declined by 8.5%. Azithromycin and Dipimed grew well. When you come to the gross margins, Q1 FY23 is 55.3% as compared to the previous quarter, which is 57.8%. This is mainly due to a price erosion in America to create inventory normalization that I just spoke about and of course the shelf stock adjustment. There is of course impact of cost inflation also, which is actually there in the gross margin line. When you talk about employee benefits, Q1 FY23 is INR 778 crores vis-a-vis INR 703 crores in the previous quarter, and this is essentially because the previous quarter also had an adjustment in terms of taking some part of the expenditure in other expenses. There is of course the impact of increments which were rolled out in FY23 which came in the quarter one. There is of course workforce planning at the plant level which impacted about 14% of the workforce and there would be savings from there, which should start flowing from Q2. On an ongoing basis, we expect employee cost to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. On the EBITDA front, operating EBITDA excluding FX and other income is 4.5% in Q1, a decline in EBITDA by 140 basis points, led by drop in sales due August 4, 2022 to trade inventory normalization, shelf stock adjustment in the US, price erosion, and on account of discontinuing products during the quarter. R&D expenditure is about INR 348 crores vis-a-vis 342 crores in the previous quarter. The ETR is expected to be around 35% as few subsidiaries are still making losses. In terms of the working capital, its increased to 147 days from 140. However, we are working on this and we would like to bring it down in the quarters to come. With the short commentary, may I open the floor for discussions.",

      "content": "Hi, everyone. This is Vinita Gupta here. A very warm welcome to our Q2 earnings call. I have with me our Managing Director, Nilesh, as well as our CFO, Ramesh and members of our Finance and Investor Relations teams. Trust you all have seen our numbers for the quarter, and Ramesh will share a deeper analysis of our performance. As you would have noted, our business has improved. Revenue growth was driven by the bounce back of our U.S. business along with continued growth in our India business, and also growth across all other geographies. On the margin front, we see the benefit of our optimization measures in addition to the revenue growth in the business. We are focused on sustaining this positive momentum for the rest of the year. I would like to share some of the business highlights with you. On the U.S. front, we have continued to evolve our business with optimization of oral solids, driving growth of complex generics, respiratory franchise, in particular and executing on our new product launches. During the quarter, our respiratory franchise contribution increased, and we executed on a couple of new product launches in particular Suprep that will help growth in Q3 and Q4. It had some contribution in Q2, but since it was launched in September, more to come in Q3 and Q4. In addition, we closed our acquisition of the Sunovion brands, Brovana and Xopenex that will enable us to enhance our respiratory position in the U.S., while contributing to revenue as well as profitability growth. As we look at the quarters ahead, we have new product launches like Spiriva, Diazepam Gel, Nascobal Nasal Spray and Darunavir, multiple products where we have exclusivity or first-to-market position that will enable us to grow our U.S. business in a profitable manner. On Spiriva, while we had hoped to get an approval by now, we are close. We have responded to all the queries the agency had raised and are working closely with the FDA to get approval by our eligible launch date. We will know more in the next few weeks, and well share what we learn with all of you. In any case, we see this as a substantial contributor for fiscal year 24 and will definitely have a significant runway based on the competitive position at present. November 10, 2022 Switching to India, the largest part of our business, while our growth in the quarter and the first half has been below market, this is primarily due to the loss of Cidmus from our cardiovascular portfolio and generalisation in the gliptins. But for the diabetes portfolio, our India business grew ahead of the market. Also, the diabetes franchise, while impacted in the near term, we expect growth in the mid- to long term given the continued growth in diagnosis and increased affordability with generics coming to the market, and our own generics. In our top therapy areas, respiratory and cardiac growth was in line with the market and therapeutic areas that we are trying to build like GI and womens health were well above the market. We expect the second half of the year to be better than H1 from a growth perspective and are committed to get our India business back to double-digit growth in the quarters and years to come. All other markets continued to grow and perform as per expectations, in particular, we saw a really strong local currency growth in Mexico and strong double-digit growth across Australia, Germany, Canada and U.K., our other developed markets. On the margin front, we have seen significant efforts that we have had underway in the last 12 to 18 months’ payoff, our margins did improve, and we expect to see this benefit continue in the quarters to come despite inflationary pressures. A word on the compliance front, we have made progress this past year with the clearance of Goa and Somerset warning letters and successful inspection of Ankleshwar and Nagpur. However, the warning letter at Tarapur certainly was disappointing for us. We have clarified with the agency that it is only specific products that we have discontinued over the last couple of years from the site and we continue to manufacture a number of key products with a clear commitment to meet the FDAs concerns on nitrosamine and cross-contamination that they highlighted to us during the inspection and in the warning letter. Overall, we are moving in the right direction, as you can see from what we have delivered in the quarter and are really committed to grow both revenues and profitability in the quarters to come, while executing on our strategic plan. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

It hasnt been promoted in multiple years, so we will evaluate the potential of November 10, 2022 promoting the product with a small-scale investment, and also look at leveraging our manufacturing capability to improve the margin profile of the product. Right now, its contract manufactured, and well certainly continue the relationships in the next couple of years.

Obviously, the high investment areas are areas like inhalation, injectables, then some biosimilars, and obviously a steady portfolio of the oral solids, ophthalmic kind of products as well. Over the period of the last few years, weve obviously changed from focusing primarily on oral solids to these differentiated dosage forms and our intention would be to continue that. I think the budget is pretty well set as youve seen, I think last couple of years we basically stayed at this kind of number, including the number that we reported this quarter as well.

I think the first option was to spin out oncology altogether, transition the entire engine into an engine that produces oncology assets. Its obviously been a tough financial market at this point in time. And so we decided to focus primarily on the development assets that we have. We have 5 development assets pretty much all in the oncology space. Those are the ones that were taking ahead. And in the meanwhile, weve scaled down the NCE team. So, weve reduced the burn very significantly. And the primary burn going forward will be the investment into the clinical development of these 5 assets.",

      "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, friends. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q3 earnings call. I have with me our Managing Director, Nilesh as well as our CFO, Ramesh. As you would have noted, we have continued to build on our momentum in Q3, both on revenues and in particular, on margins. Im very pleased that in Q3, our US business performed well, India business growth improved, and API business rebounded as well. On the margin front, we saw the benefit of NPLs in the US, seasonal product upside as well, and continued savings from our optimization measures. We are focused on sustaining this positive momentum, in particular as material new product launches start and our recent investment in our sales force expansion in India starts yielding results. I will let Ramesh talk through the performance in deeper detail. I would like to share some of the business highlights. In the US, we have continued to evolve our business with optimization of oral solids, driving growth of complex generics, respiratory franchise in particular, and executing on our new product launches. During the quarter, our in-line business was almost flat with slight decline due to exit from low-margin products, offset almost completely by seasonal products. New product launches in the year contributed well in the quarter, with Suprep ramping up, Perforomist generic successful launch and then Pennsaid authorized generic launch. Our respiratory franchise strengthened with albuterol continued strong performance, addition of Brovana and Xopenex brands as well as generics launch. As we look at the quarters ahead, we expect new product launches like gSpiriva, gDiazepam Gel, gNascobal Nasal Spray and gDarunavir, all products where we have either exclusivity or first to market position, which will drive growth of our US business in a profitable manner. On Spiriva, we continue to make progress and have received priority review from the FDA for a target action date in April, without inspection, or July, with inspection. In the meantime, we are getting ready with launch preparedness. We continue to see Tiotropium as a substantial opportunity for fiscal year 24 with a significant runway, given the competitive dynamics. Products like gDiazepam Gel and gNascobal, we now hope to see approval soon given the recent successful Somerset audit. Our US generics business has come a long way in calendar year 22, still a long way to go. However, with the February 10, 2023 new product launches coming in, continued optimization efforts, focused efforts on building a niche inhalation, as well as injectables pipeline, we are optimistic that we will grow our US business in the next couple of years. Switching to India, the largest part of our business, while our growth in the quarter and first half has been below market, this is primarily due to loss of Cidmus from a cardiovascular portfolio and genericization in the diabetes segment in the gliptins. But for the diabetes portfolio, our growth in Q3 was in line with market, with therapeutic areas like cardiac, GI, respiratory, all delivering double-digit growth. Our gynaecology and GI have actually been the fastest growth therapeutic areas for us. This quarter, we have added close to a 1,000 reps, created six new divisions to expand our reach and share of wallets. We expect the investments to get us to above market growth in the quarters ahead. We are committed to growing our India business to double- digit growth in the quarters ahead. Other than India and the US, our API business recovered with the growth in cephalosporins and other countries like UK on the back of Fostair generic and Germany due to NaMuscula grew as well quarter-over-quarter. On the margin front, we expect continued improvement in particular as we execute on new product launches and our recent investment in the sales force in India starts yielding results. Likewise, we continue to focus on cost optimization efforts. While we have been successful in optimizing our manpower costs, we have been very disciplined in getting out of low margin products that has not allowed us to optimize our idle costs. Nevertheless, we are confident with the efforts that we have underway, we should be able to move the needle on this front in the quarters to come as well. On the compliance front, we have made progress with positive outcomes on sites like Ankleshwar, Nagpur injectables and Somerset. Weve also made substantial progress on our remediation efforts in Tarapur and Mandideep. The recent approval of our injectables facility will enable us to start building our organic injectables portfolio in full earnest. Overall, we are moving in the right direction. We expect the pace to get better, as we execute on our material new product launches in the quarters ahead. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for deeper analysis of our performance.",

Were very pleased to close the fiscal year with continued improvement in operating margins. Our team has had a sharp focus on getting our India business back to double digit growth and quarter after quarter improvement in US margins as well this focus along with growth in other areas like API, EMEA and APAC enabled us to deliver margin improvement as planned. We are committed to sustaining this positive momentum into the new fiscal year and driving strong growth across all our regions in particular: India, based on our recent salesforce expansion; and the US aided by material new product launches. Our India business as you would have noted recorded an 11% plus growth per IQVIA, ex the diabetes portfolio growth was 15% plus, in line with the market growth. In Q4, we made a significant investment to expand our sales force in India and enhance our reach. Were very pleased that overall we delivered margin improvement for the organization despite this material investment. In the US we improved our margins for a third quarter in a row through portfolio optimization, maximizing the high value products and continued cost optimization efforts. We were able to improve our margins despite increase in R&D spends quarter over quarter. Overall, when you look at it for the year, the R&D spend for the US was $100 million with an increasing proportion of complex generics in particular inhalation and injectables. Apart from India getting to double digit growth and U.S. business improvement, our API business recovered in the quarter with demand growth in our core products. Our EMEA business grew driven by South Africa quarter over quarter and Fostair (Luforbec) in Europe year over year. In APAC, our Philippines subsidiary performed very well. Switching to R&D, we continue to drive the shift to complex genetics with a focus on respiratory and injectable products. We filed 19 products in the US and 10 ex-US. Of the US filings, we had four injectables, 3 nasal sprays and we made progress on Respimat and Ellipta products on both platforms. Apart from generics, on the R&D front, we optimized the New Chemical Entity (NCE) R&D spent in Q3 to focus on only two of our oncology pipeline programs, significantly reducing the discovery spend. Switching to compliance, weve made progress in part with positive outcomes on the Ankleshwar, Vizag, Nagpur injectables and Somerset sites. Weve also May 10, 2023 made substantial progress on our remediation efforts in Tarapur, Mandideep Unit 1 and Pithampur Unit 2. We are committed to ensure that we get all our sites to a consistent and sustainable level of compliance. Im sure well see more progress on this front in fiscal year 2024. On the M&A front, our recent acquisitions have performed well with Anglo French; Southern Cross; Xopenex, Brovana in the US and Paloma in Brazil, all delivering as per plan. Our recent acquisition of Medisol in France enables us to accelerate our injectables franchise in Europe. We are very pleased to be able to close that. We have come a long way in fiscal year 2023 and I am excited about the prospects in fiscal year 24 as we launch products like Tiotropium, Darunavir and others in the US and drive consistent double-digit growth in our India business. We remain focused on driving operating margin improvement as we grow our business. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

A very large portion of that got wiped out by inflationary costs as we discussed. Same way on the SG&A front, theres a significant increase, the majority of that increase is towards India and the related adjacencies that we have. In fact, weve optimized expenses on a bunch elsewhere. So there is an optimization plan in the US that is actually whats helping getting the numbers to a better level at this point of time. But theres also an investment plan in markets like India that is resulting in increase in some of these lines as well. So its not going to look linear from that perspective. Its going to be different strokes in different markets. But US clearly moving down the optimization path, clearly the focus on new product launches as well. In markets like India, were obviously investing. Like we said, we added the sales force, theres a cost attached to it, thats just started. So theres going to be additional selling promotions spend that will come around that as well. But that obviously is with a clear visibility of return that we will give starting within 12 months from the time that we get the sales force on the ground. So I think the margin will obviously improve, but there are these forces moving things up and down a little bit.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, welcome to a refreshing set of numbers. On the last occasion that we met, we did promise you that our results and margins would get to be better in successive quarters. We have endeavoured to live up to that guidance. August 4, 2023 Sales for Q1 FY24 came in at INR 4,742 crores as compared to INR 4,330 crores in Q4 FY23, a growth of 9.5% QoQ. On a YoY basis, the company registered a growth of 31.6% over Q1 FY23 sales of INR 3,604 crores. The sales of Q1 FY24 included $25 mn income from Abbvie for key milestone of initiation of Phase 1 clinical trials. Excluding the same our sales were 4,537 crores which represented a growth of 4.8% QOQ and 25.9% YOY. Our sales growth this quarter has been robust across all our key geographies. The US market registered a growth of 3.6% QOQ and 49% YOY (in local currency terms) whilst the India branded business registered a growth of 11.5% QOQ and 10.2% YOY. The API business registered growth of 4.5% YOY and 32.1% QOQ. During the quarter, the US business registered a growth of 3.6% (in USD terms) on QoQ basis as sales went up to $ 180.7mn from $ 174.5mn in the previous quarter. In Q1 FY’23 the sales were only $ 121.3mn. Products like Darunavir, Suprep contributed to this robust performance. We are continuing to maximizing the high value products resulting in a sustainable and profitable US business. India Branded Formulations business sales improved by 11.5% QOQ and against previous year the sales improved by 10.2%. Our growth excluding Cidmus and NLEM is a robust 13.60%. API business sales grew by 4.5% on QoQ basis due to higher 7ACCA sales as core cephalosporin API sales recovered handsomely. Similarly, on YoY basis sales growth was at 32.1% led by higher sales thanks to good demand pick up in the cephalosporin API. Q1 FY24 gross margin is at 65.4% and at 63.8% ex NCE income, as compared to Q4 FY23 gross margins of 59.6.% (a Variance of about 6.8%). The improvement in margins quarter on quarter is driven by US as well as India. In the US, we had NPL launches, better mix, higher price realization in few products and reduction in freight expenses. The margins also expanded due to higher better mix both in IRF and API apart from other reasons. We do expect this margin to sustain We have improved significantly from last year Q1, when our gross margin was 55.3% to the current levels of 63.8%. The improvement, again, was driven in US margin as Q1 margin last year in US was at all-time low. Improvement in India and API margins are also the other major contributors to the overall margin improvement year on year August 4, 2023 Q1FY24 is at INR 853 crores which translates to approximately 18.5% of adjusted sales vs INR 773 crores in Q4FY23 which translates to approximately 18% of sales. The same was INR 779 crores or 24% of sales in Q1FY23. The QoQ increase is mainly due to annual increments which were to the tune of 7.5% across the globe. Q1FY24 manufacturing and other expenses came in at INR 1,472 crores vs INR 1,303 crores in Q4FY23. These expenses were reported at INR 1,192 crores in Q1FY23. The QoQ Increase is on account of higher spends in R&D, increased consultancy charges for nitrosamine related impurities, increase in selling and promotion expenses in India due to field force expansion. Same reasons were also responsible for the year on year increase. R&D is at INR 368 crores (7.8 % of sales) in Q1 FY24 as compared to 1,280 crores in full year FY23 which was 7.9% of sales. The increase in R&D QOQ is on account of investment in newer platforms of biosimilars and injectables. Our EBITDA came in at INR 879 crores in absolute terms, representing an 18.5% margin. Excluding one-time NCE income, Forex and other income, our EBITDA margin was at 14.4% or 651 crores, reflecting an improvement of 50 bps in comparison to the previous quarter. The improvement in EBIDTA is primarily driven by higher gross margin, partially offset by higher expenditure in R&D, higher employee cost due to salary hikes and higher PLI income in base quarter. The Effective Tax Rate was 18.9% in Q1 against FY’23 ETR FY’23 of 36.9%. The lower ETR is primarily on account of US subsidiary which has seen a turnaround, offsetting the NOLs of prior year, and the ETR was also lower on part of Sikkim tax benefits. The ETR for the full year is expected to remain between 21%-22%. Operating working capital was at INR 5,195 crore as on June 30, 2023 which translates into 103 operating days. This has reduced from 119 days at March 31, 2023. Net Debt as on June 30, 2023 stands at INR 1,310 crores which has come down from 2,500 crores at the end of Q4FY23. We have done repayment of packing August 4, 2023 credit loans in India and also retired some debt in Australia. With this, we could open the floor for discussions.",

As I think we shared even last quarter, we had a discovery effort that we pretty much closed down, which was the bulk of the investment. And we decided to pursue the three pipeline programs to see if we can really get any signal in terms of efficacy on the programs. So, in trials that were doing in India, at a fraction of what it will cost us in the U.S. So right now the effort is pretty low-single digit in terms of millions of dollars. And, one program in the clinic in phase one. And, if we see positive results, really it will lead to licensing effort or an effort to finance it through external funding. We dont have plans to commercialize these -- the NCEs ourselves or take on major risk on the NCE front ourselves.",

      "content": "Yes. So out of Indore, in particular, the ophthalmic products, we see a nice opportunity around in five or six products that we have filed from the site. Some of them were just pending because of facility, which now should happen. Like PROLENSA is the first of the pipeline opportunities that really is an upside for us this fiscal year. The other, we have products like Brimonidine, products like Prednisone, like five or six products that are meaningful out of the ophthalmic facility, and in particular now with the shortages in the marketplace on the ophthalmic front, we see a nice opportunity for these products. We should have PROLENSA this year. And we think that three or four products are going to be next year, next fiscal year. To your second question on the evolution of a pipeline into complex generics, on the inhalation front, of course, MDIs and now with Spiriva, DPI, nicely expanding our portfolio franchise. And we are actively working on other DPI platforms, Ellipta in particular, we have made significant progress. We hope to report at the end of this fiscal year, a material milestone on that front, on one of our products. On Respimat also, we have made significant progress, and well make more so in the next fiscal year. But Ellipta, we have made significant August 4, 2023 progress so far. On the MDI front, there are a couple of products that we are pursuing. And then we are actively also taking a look at the whole move towards Green Propellants in the U.S. and Europe, and working on both the current product of 505 (j) to the current product, as well as the novel propellant versions of the MDIs, that can enable us to potentially have some differentiation and exclusivity in the marketplace. So, Id say that strong progress on the DPI front and Respimat, and some progress on the MDI front, especially given the Green Propellant move, we are watching that carefully, so that we dont have to - we make an investment and have to redo a product completely. So, thats on the inhalation front. On the injectables front, as I mentioned earlier, we are adding to our pipeline very actively right now. We have multiple 505 (j) products and 505 (b) (2) products that we have added to our pipeline already. Nine products in active pipeline this year have been added to the injectable pipeline. And apart from that, Id say, I think back on the respiratory front, we also have nasal sprays that we are actively working upon. And lastly, Id say, on the implants and devices, we have made good progress on products like Nexplanon and Mirena, where we have developed equivalent versions of the products and are actively working on the clinic right now.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Good evening Friends, Seasons Greetings to you and your families. I welcome you all to our Q2 FY24 earnings call. On the last occasion that we met, we mentioned that we would strive to achieve around 18% EBITDA margin by Q4 of the current year. I am happy that we have delivered on our promise, in this quarter itself. Now, diving deeper into the numbers. Sales for Q2 FY24 came in at INR 4,939 crores as compared to INR 4,091 crores in Q2 last year, a growth of 20.7% YoY. On a QoQ basis, the company reported growth of 4.2% and 8.9% after excluding NCE income, over Q1 FY24. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. North America has grown at a strong 40% YoY and 17.4% QoQ. India business has grown at 6.8% YoY whilst EMEA grew at 24% YoY. Our API business registered growth of 7% YOY. November 9, 2023 Moving on to US Business - During the quarter, the US business recorded a sales of $213 mn registering a growth of 34% YoY and 18% on QoQ basis. Just to indicate the size of the ramp up, this number was $159 mn in Q2 FY’23. This growth has been led by New Products and by also our legacy products maintaining their market share. I am happy to share that our strategy to build complex portfolio is bearing shape and today, inhalation products are more than 40% of our US sales. Coming to India, the India Region Formulations business (IRF) has grown by 6.9% YoY. Our growth excluding NLEM is 8.9% YoY. As per IQVIA, all our key segments except for anti-diabetes, have grown faster than the market in the quarter including cardiovascular space, respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI) and gynaecology. Even in the anti-diabetes space, our non inlicensed portfolio has grown at 10% vs IPM category growth of 4.9%. Currently the inlicensed portfolio constitutes around 13% of our IRF business vs 15.5% in FY23. Speaking about EMEA region, which constitutes our EU region business and South Africa business, has performed exceptionally well during the quarter with a strong growth of 24% YoY. Growth in EU has been driven by our inhalation business going strong with products like Luforbec and Beclu gaining additional share and entering newer markets. EU also saw increased tender sales. I am delighted to share that we recorded our highest ever sales in Germany during the quarter. Moving to the margins front. Coming to the profitability, Q2 FY24 gross margins are at 65.5% which has increased 170 bps from 63.8% ex NCE income in Q1 FY24 and materially from 58.1 % in Q2 last year. This improvement was driven by multiple factors which include better product mix, lower share of inlicense products, commodity deflation, increased volumes and realization of savings from few of the cost improvement initiatives like freight and other things we took on. Employee Benefits expense -Employee benefits expense at INR 861 crores, has increased 11.5% YoY in Q2 FY24 which translates to approximately 17.4% of sales as compared to 18.6% of adjusted sales (excluding NCE) in Q1. and 18.9% in Q2 last year. While there has been a reduction in percentage to sales due to our cost optimization initiatives, I would like to mention that there is an November 9, 2023 offsetting impact due to the field force expansion which we undertook last year and other new initiatives. Manufacturing & Other Expenses - Q2FY24 manufacturing and other expenses came in at INR 1,552 crores which translates to approximately 31.4% of sales as compared to 32.5% of adjusted sales (excluding NCE) in Q1 and 30% in Q2 last year. The YoY increase is on account of higher volumes, higher spends in R&D, increased consultancy charges for nitrosamine impurities, increase in selling, promotion and travelling expense in India due to field force expansion and the like. R&D is at INR 376 crores (7.6 % of sales) in Q2 FY24 as compared to INR 338 crores at 8.0% of sales in Q2FY23. The increase in R&D YoY is on account of investment in newer platforms of biosimilars, injectables and the like. For the full year, we expect R&D to be around INR 1,500 to INR 1,600 crs.",

November 9, 2023 Vinita D. Gupta: Yes, so were tracking the market very closely right now, and of course, waiting for the site and product approval before making concrete plans. But, as the market evolves, the access model gets a little bit simpler as we see it, with established channels in the marketplace. So, we are constantly tracking, and plan even with a direct-to-market salesforce effort to really have a very targeted niche salesforce that can double-up with our injectable business, so we can have some operating leverage as opposed to having a single product investment. So, watching that carefully, and we also have, apart from our own plans and potential to launch, we also have interest from partners. And were going to closely track our OBI product development to determine what is the best route for us to go.",

Id say on the developed market side, U.S. as well as Europe, Canada, Australia We would see majority of our portfolio, two-thirds of it switching to complex generics based on the investment that weve made and the execution so far, inhalation, injectables, really contributing a material part of our growth over the next five years. On the profitability front, we have come a long way over the last year and a half, still a long way to go. Our highs of 20 margins certainly are aspirational for us. Right now, we can see a path over the next few years to get to a good 20% plus. Mid 20s is our goal, to really close the gap with our peers. There’s no reason why we should be below that. But as we continue to look at the company prospects beyond five years and look at investment plans in particular in areas like specialty, which long-term are our aspiration for our organization. Well have to determine what kind of investments we make. So, wed hope to get to 20% plus, then the mid-20s and then well determine whats the best way to grow our organization for the long-term.",

While the product is a USD 10 billion and minimum opportunity one would be expecting would be few hundred million dollars out of the product. And the kind of a spend in that development itself would be USD 100 million plus or near about USD 100 million. They are selling the entire opportunity rights and everything for USD 40 million.

And also the brand really held onto the product for really long. So the biosimilars were competing with the brand. Having said that, Sandoz has now had some success in that marketplace. Biosimilars have really turned out to be a difficult marketplace, given the high investment, not only the development, but access to market. And then depending on what the brands end up doing, the difficulty in gaining share. I mean, for us, Ranibizumab is more of a niche opportunity. It is a smaller product. Its not the USD 10 billion product that attracts everybody. And, yes, there are other competitors, but not in the same competitive intensity as Humira®. And like I said, that its a more streamlined market access that we are expecting here. So, were not expecting to make significant commercial investment to access the marketplace. We have partnerships with companies in place to really get access and gain share. So, were not really concerned about the investment that we have made. The investment also, relatively August 7, 2024 speaking, in Ranibizumab has been smaller than products like even Enbrel®. Etanercept for us, or what Adalimumab would have cost all the biosimilar companies.",

      "content": "Thank you, Ravi. Well, its a real pleasure to meet all of you here today in person. I know we havent done a face-to-face meeting for a good number of years. The last time I recall we met, it was I think in 2022, when we were just coming out of COVID, had gone through a number of challenges that had impacted our performance. And from there, in 2022, with the efforts that we worked upon, I think about it, number one, execution of new product launches, in particular in the US, to turn around the US business, leveraging our complex generic portfolio to build Other Developed Markets, growing India and Other Emerging Markets on a consistent basis. At the same time, focus on cost optimization whether its footprint rationalization or broad efficiency measures, and third, our quality and compliance efforts that enabled us to work through our OAI sites, 3 sites in particular, have really enabled us to turn our business around over the last 3 years. We are very pleased that fiscal year ‘25 has been a stellar year for the organization where we have continued the momentum, the growth momentum, as well as continue to evolve our strategic growth drivers and capabilities to continue to grow in the future. So we look forward to sharing with you our performance thus far and our plans going forward. So before that, I will just start with where Lupin is today. When you look at our company globally, we are the 12th largest generic company by revenues. We had a great year with USD 2.7 billion in revenue and USD 625 million in EBITDA, delivered by a very strong group of Lupinytts. When you look at our presence across our key markets, we have a leadership position in all our key markets. Starting with the US, where we are the 3rd largest company by prescriptions dispensed. India, where we are the 8th largest, primarily organically. I mean there are companies that have done acquisitions that have gone above us but from an organic growth standpoint, we have consistently May 15, 2025 grown our India business. And other markets like Australia, where we are the 4th largest company on the generic front, and South Africa, where we are the 8th largest company on the generic front. So really a substantial position in all our critical markets, driven by a very strong pipeline of generics, branded drugs, as well as complex generics. If you look at our business globally, for this past year, its very well diversified. You look at the Developed Markets and the Emerging Markets. The US and Other Developed Markets are roughly 50%, India and Other Emerging markets are roughly 50%. And when you look at the nature of the business, the India and Emerging Market is primarily branded business. US, Other Developed Market is primarily generic business. So very well diversified business geographically. Very pleased with the progress we have made on the ESG front. So its been a stellar year for us, not only from a financial perspective, building on the growth momentum but also growing sustainably as an organization. So this is our current footprint around the world. In particular, on the manufacturing front, we have a very strong footprint that supports our generic business globally, with 15 manufacturing sites around the world, 4 in the Americas, 2 in the US in particular, that give us tremendous capability and flexibility to be able to manufacture more in the US If it made sense, based on the tariff considerations and also the economic incentives that the government puts in place, if its attractive, we will have the flexibility to manufacture more in the US Look at our R&D centres, seven R&D centres around the world, including 4 in the Americas again, 2 in the US, as well as in Mexico and Brazil, and then 1 in the Netherlands, the Nanomi long-acting injectable R&D centre in Nanomi. So tremendous capabilities on the R&D and manufacturing front to drive our growth going forward as an organization. You look at our manufacturing plants, in particular, for the US, we have 12 plants that serve the US market. Id say 11 right now because the Pune biotech facility is yet to be approved by the FDA, but have multiple manufacturing sites that are approved by the FDA, as well as other regulators that enable us to build our generic business. So if you look at our major pillars of growth, you saw our purpose statement that we take a lot of pride in. We put a lot of effort in crystallizing that statement and are very proud of catalysing treatments, both across innovative medicines as well as affordable medicines to serve the communities and the patients that we provide drugs to. When you look at our major pillars of our business, the US in particular has come a long way for the organization, evolving our portfolio from the simple products to complex generics, in particular on the inhalation front, very soon on the injectable front as well, fiscal year ‘26 is going to be a material year on the injectables front, and biosimilars, which is an opportunity that is emerging now for us. Theres been a lot of back and forth on the biosimilars front over the last couple of years, but given the change from a regulatory perspective, May 15, 2025 the FDA reducing the requirements for interchangeability studies, as well as the private label model appearing in the US, the US is emerging as an attractive biosimilars market, of course with selective portfolio choices. We also continue to operate our legacy business of oral solids, ophthalmic, dermatology, and leverage product opportunities that differentiate us, like you have seen Mirabegron, Tolvaptan that is going to be a material contributor in fiscal year ‘26. So the US is on a very strong foundation, a very strong trajectory from a growth perspective in the next couple of years. Other Developed Markets, especially Europe, Canada, Australia, leveraging our portfolio in the US, the platforms in the US, complex generics are the largest part of growth in Other Developed Markets and allow us to really build both on our capacities, manufacturing as well as R&D capabilities, to gain operating leverage across the globe. In India, we continue to focus on delivering growth above the market. The last 5 years, the last 10 years, we have consistently grown above the market. Wed like to grow 1.2, 1.3 times the market and we have done that in many years. The last couple of years, with the loss of exclusivity on-inlicensed products, the growth has been a little below that, but its still been above market growth over the last many years. Our strategy is both innovative products as well as a pipeline that we have built internally as well as licensed through partners, and acquisitions. You saw recently we acquired the insulin brand from Lilly, which enables us to really gain the end-to-end economics on the product. And we will continue to look at acquisition opportunities to bolster our portfolio in the India business. Simultaneously, we also are expanding our footprint. We have done pretty well in terms of sales force expansion over the last couple of years, and continue to focus on expanding our footprint as a business within India. Also, you have seen us getting into strategic adjacencies that enable us to go beyond the pill, beyond the prescription medicine, into diagnostics, digital, OTC products that enable us to bring a full solution to the patient as opposed to just the prescription. We are starting to see the benefits of the strategy. We are starting to see the impact of the strategy on our prescription business, and we will continue to evolve these areas to be able to both strategically contribute to our position in the marketplace as well as build value through these efforts. Other Emerging Markets, in particular South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Philippines, we have strong local businesses that are pretty self-sustaining. All of them tend to really run the business on a positive cash flow, on growing profitably, primarily through their own pipeline developed internally or in- licensed, but also, where possible, integrate with Lupins pipeline in particular in the key areas like respiratory, CNS, biologics as well. In the Emerging Markets we also have a strong position in institutional business with our TB Portfolio, which is the companys legacy business. I am very proud that we are continuing to maintain a leadership position in this segment. On the API front, we have built substantial scale, and its enabled us to really build a very strong reliability of supply on the generic side of the business. This has been a critical piece of discussion in the US conversations very May 15, 2025 recently, where the US would like to bring API manufacturing in the US if possible but we as an organization have more than 50% of our generic portfolio vertically integrated through our own APIs that enables us to really have a very strong cost position as well as reliability of supply that we have been able to leverage to ensure that we meet the market requirements on a consistent basis. We also have leveraged the API business and capabilities to build a CDMO business, as you saw. This past year, we have made significant progress there in terms of the teams and capabilities and we will continue to evolve our CDMO business based on these API capabilities to be able to build value with this vertical. So, multiple growth drivers in the organization, that give us the confidence of consistent growth going forward. So, when I look at the journey over the last 5 years, there are many areas to highlight. On the commercial front, the turnaround of the US business was a material event for us over the last couple of years that enabled us to get back to consistent growth and more importantly profitable growth for the organization, and evolve our EBITDA margins on a consistent basis over the last 10 to 12 quarters. On the complex generic front, we were the first Indian company to launch a DPI in the US We were very proud with Spiriva® to be able to get that approval in 2023 and launch it as a sole generic. We are still the only generic in the marketplace. It took us long, 5 years from filing to get FDA approval but its enabled us to build Respiratory as a major vertical for our business in the US When I look at our MDI and DPI business in the US, right now its one-third of our US portfolio from a revenue’s perspective. So a material contributor to our business in the US as well as globally and also differentiates us as an organization. In India, we have expanded our position with 11 new divisions, a field force up from, it was 5,000, I think, 5 years ago, to 10,000 plus at this point, so significant expansion that has enabled us to grow above the market growth rate in the country. If you look at our chronic share in India, so again, we are very proud of this accomplishment. Five years ago, the picture looked very different. Our chronic share was sub 60% Today, its 64% chronic, so more sustainable, more profitable business. When we compare ourselves with our peers, we are actually one of the best mix of chronic versus acute as an organization in India. We have continued to focus on commercial excellence in areas that we felt needed dedicated focus, like the trade generics business that we recently spun out into a wholly-owned subsidiary, with the idea of really focusing hard on driving that business given the growth of the trade generics business in India, and Lupin Manufacturing Solutions, which again as I mentioned in the previous slide, on the API front, allows us to leverage our capabilities on the API R&D and manufacturing to build a CDMO business. We have also had strategic acquisitions over the last 5 years. Xopenex® in the US enabled us to get into the brand side of the business. When Sunovion was looking to get out of the market, we thought it was a strategic opportunity for us to have a foot into the brand business on the respiratory front in particular. May 15, 2025 The product has grown since we acquired with very limited promotion efforts, so we are looking at how we can build further on this start. Medisol in France that enabled us to get into, we didnt have a presence in France until we acquired Medisol, which gave us a very nice injectables portfolio that enables us to build our internal pipeline on top of this to build a business in France. And Southern Cross in Australia that allowed us to almost double our business, has been a significant contributor to growth in the Australian market and has enabled us to get to that position of 4th largest generic in the Australian market. If you look at the material product launches over the last 5 years, Suprep® from Somerset, Albuterol from India, Spiriva® that I just mentioned, our first dry powder inhaler in the US, Mirabegron, material contributor in the last fiscal year and continues to be this fiscal year as well. In India, we were very pleased to launch differentiated products like Difizma and Vilfuro, unique novel respiratory products that enable us to differentiate our product offering with the pulmonologist. In Europe, Luforbec® which is a Fostair® generic has enabled us to really double our business in Europe, so significant contributor to growing our business in Europe that has done extremely well over the last 3 to 5 years. And NaMuscla®, our first orphan drug, our first brand in Europe has grown very nicely over the last 5 years as well. We are actually in the process of the second indication. We started with the NDM indication which is smaller indication. DM indication is much larger. We are going through a phase 3 study at present for the DM indication in Europe as well as the US that will enable us to maximize this brand globally. And lastly, Etanercept, which has been a material contributor to our business in Europe as well as other parts of the world, Japan, Southeast Asia, Latin America. We are very pleased with how things are evolving in the US and will determine how we commercialize this product in the US in the years ahead. 2029 is when the patent goes off in the US If you look at the impact on the financials, we have improved our gross margins from 64 %, 5 years ago to 69 %. Look at our EBITDA margins, gone from 16% to 24%. We are a zero-debt company at this point, have strong cash flows and have considerably improved our ROCE from the 10 % level to 20 %. So very pleased with the financial results of all of the efforts over the last many years. On the compliance front, we have made material strides, getting 3 of our sites, Pithampur, Goa, Somerset out of warning letters to a VAI status. I am confident if the FDA was to visit the 2 pending sites, Mandideep as well as Tarapur, our sites are ready to receive them. But we dont have any pending products from the sites, so they dont have any hurry to come in and inspect these sites. But I am confident in the near future we will get those sites cleared as well. The last couple of years, its not been quiet. We have had multiple inspections across all of our different facilities and we have sailed through each of them. So looking forward to continuing that strong trajectory going forward. You can see the impact of all of these efforts over the last 5 years. I just mentioned the financial results but as you can see from the chart, the last 3 years has May 15, 2025 been a really strong trajectory for us and has also reflected in the shareholder value that has built over the last few years. So for fiscal year ‘25, you have already seen the numbers, so I am not going to reiterate them. Its been a stellar year from a revenue growth standpoint, from a margin growth standpoint, from a net income standpoint. But we are very pleased that all our markets, all our regions, grew this past year. And the majority of them grew double-digit. If you look at India, it grew at 14%. North America grew at 16%. US per se grew at 17%. EMEA grew 22%, so a stellar year in EMEA. APAC grew 5%. LATAM grew 10% after a Mexico facility came back up last year. Its now back to the pre-closure levels. So very pleased with the growth there as well. The Rest Of World, along with our GIB business, the tuberculosis TB tender business grew 11%, and our API business grew 3%. So a stellar year for us as an organization. So I want to switch from there to a couple of the trends in our industry. As we are looking at the industry, certainly a lot happening in the US but also multiple other trends that pose both challenges as well as opportunities for us as an organization. If I look at the geopolitical situation, a lot of things happening around the globe that really put India in a very strong position, in particular as countries and regions are de-risking from China. The US in particular is very focused on de-risking from China, and India I think is very well positioned to leverage that opportunity on multiple fronts. Tariffs are certainly going to shape the trade relationships between countries. The US is every day, every week in the news about tariffs on China, tariffs on other countries, tariffs on India. We are hopeful that, based on the bilateral trade negotiation between India and the US, the importance of Indian pharma sector in the US, given 50% of the prescriptions in the US come from India, that we are going to be able to convince the stakeholders to have either zero tariff or limited tariff on drugs from India. Certainly theres been a statement from the Trump administration on that front in the last couple of weeks that sounded promising, so fingers crossed on that front. Theres a paradigm shift in the US healthcare industry with all of the changes the new administration has made, a number of areas that are impacted so far. Many healthcare programmes have been impacted. A lot of research funding has been impacted in the US DOGE has made material cuts across multiple areas. FDA has lost 20,000 people. Thankfully the reviewers are still there. I mean, they cut a lot of the policy folks but not the review branch that actively reviews and approves products. The Inflation Reduction Act, you know, the government is actively reviewing the pill penalty on IRA. As a number of you might know, the IRA allowed HHS to negotiate drug pricing for biologics 13 years after the product is approved, while on small molecules its 9 years after product is approved, which was considered really a discrimination against small molecules. And that is under active review at this point, so we expect that it could land in the same place as biologics. You have heard in the last couple of days, MFN, you know, the executive order from the Trump administration linking the pricing in the US to Most Favored Nation pricing across Developed Markets in particular. We are going to see how this evolves. I think a lot of analysts are saying this is more bark than bite. At this point, you know, a number of big pharma companies have made commitments to invest May 15, 2025 in the US and very likely will renegotiate or backtrack those commitments if the government is going to peg pricing to overseas markets. We know that the US market actually funds for majority of the innovation in our industry, so really reducing pricing in the US is going to have a significant impact on the innovation front in the pharmaceutical industry. Theres growing talk about onshoring manufacturing in the US As I mentioned, this is likely going to be very closely linked with what the administration does on the MFN front, also very closely linked to what happens on tariffs, if there are material tariffs in place and theres an economic incentive to manufacture locally that makes products more viable. Certainly there will be an opportunity to expand manufacturing in the US. Switching to India, the pharma industry in India is poised to grow, double in the next 5 years, and this is not just in India, but also exports from India outside of the country. So its expectation of the revenues of the entire industry out of India is expected to double over the next 5 years. This would be fuelled a good part by the growth in the middle class, you know, thats expected to be 170 million people by 2030 and also very pleased that the government is now supporting ‘Develop in India’ in the new R&D scheme, the research scheme, incentive scheme that the government has talked about putting in place. Just like the production link scheme, PLI scheme, that has really benefited the industry in the last 5 years, we expect that this will certainly encourage more innovation in India and was much needed for the country. The India opportunities pivoting from pharma alone to overall healthcare, we talked a little bit about this in our context and patient-centric adjacencies like diagnostics, digital health, consumer health is gaining momentum. So the full solution for patients and physicians is gaining momentum in India. On the generic side of the business for the Developed Markets, there certainly is a move towards complex generics, as well as specialty. We see multiple companies moving in that direction, both on the complex generic front as well as the 505(b)(2), as well as innovation front., On the complex generics front, we have executed in multiple areas, inhalation in particular, but also on the specialty, 505(b)(2) front we have active portfolio together, pipeline together of both transformative opportunities as well as incremental innovation that will help us differentiate our portfolio in countries like the US as well as Other Developed Markets. We have seen over the last couple of years’ blockbuster drug classes emerge like the GLP-1s, diabetes, obesity class that is set to grow to USD 100 billion over the next 5 years. So certainly a material opportunity that has emerged in the marketplace. And as some of these products go off patent, like Semaglutide in particular goes off patent in March of next year in a handful of countries, it will open the market for further expansion on this class of drugs. Likewise, theres also an emergence on the biologics front. In India in particular, we are seeing emergence of biologics in particular in areas like immunology and oncology that is set to grow very nicely. Lastly, the rising impact of AI across industries and in pharma as well. On the brand side of the industry, theres certainly a very strong focus on drug May 15, 2025 development front through AI, delivering efficiency, from a timing as well as cost perspective. On the generic side of the business as well, there are multiple areas where we have potential gains here, from an efficiency standpoint, commercial execution standpoint, operation standpoint, cost optimization as well as quality perspective - that our industry is going to leverage. So a lot going on across the globe in our industry. So that brings me to our strategic areas of focus as an organization, looking at all of these trends, the areas that we have prioritized for our organization. Number one is to sustain our growth in our 2 major regions, India as well as the US. And based on the portfolio we have, based on the investments that we plan to make, we are confident of continuing to grow in both regions in the foreseeable future. Second is expanding our inhalation business. We have established a very strong position on the respiratory front. Today, if I look at our global turnover, 25% or so is on the respiratory side. We were always very strong in India, but over the last 5 years we have built a significant presence in the US, Europe and emerging in other parts of the world like Canada, Australia on the respiratory front. So we continue to build on this pillar, as well as innovate. I mean, there is a material move in particular in countries like Europe to move towards green propellants on the metered-dose inhalers and we believe we are at the forefront with this. Our R&D teams, our manufacturing teams have looked at our evolution from a pipeline perspective on the green propellant side, both for India as well as developed markets like US, Europe and other parts of the world. Third, delivering on our new product launches “on time and on budget” is a major part of our focus. Its been a substantial success for us over the last 3 years. Our team has come a long way in ensuring that the products that we target, we deliver them in time. And thats how youve seen products like Mirabegron, products like Tolvaptan, products like Spiriva® come to market in time and theres a very strong focus in the organization to deliver our new product launches. Number four is establishing a Speciality business. I mean, a number of you know, we have had a legacy speciality business in the US. We actually started the US business on the speciality front, on the paediatrics side. Then over the years, we went into the womens health side of the business, which we had some success with and got out when we saw challenges 3-4 years ago, when we went through the downturn. We are refocusing our efforts on building the speciality side of the business, both with acquisitions as well as internal pipeline, especially the 505(b)(2) pipeline that we are developing in-house. Fifth is establishing injectables and biosimilars as a growth driver for the future. I mean, we have capabilities across both in R&D and manufacturing, as you know. And this year in particular, were going to see a material inflection on the injectables front with products like Glucagon, products like Liraglutide, Risperdal Consta® from Nanomi coming to market. And with the emerging biologics opportunities with the FDA regulations easing up, as well as the private label business emerging in the US, we expect biosimilars to be May 15, 2025 a material growth driver going forward. Of course, as barriers reduce, the competition tends to increase. So we are very selective with our portfolio here to ensure that we are either in the first wave or we are one of a few players that will enable us to get a solid return on our investment with biologics, as well as grow the business on a sustainable basis. Sixth is establishing a novel product pipeline. I mentioned the 505(b)(2) pipeline that we are developing internally on our long-acting injectable platform, on our respiratory platform, some oral solids as well, that will help us build both our speciality business and in some cases also help us build a hospital business in the US in particular. Then building scale across other developed generic markets. So we believe that the platforms that we have in place and the pipeline that we have in place whether its on the respiratory front, biologics front, or the injectables front, has tremendous opportunities outside of the US, in particular in Europe, Canada, as well as Australia-like countries and theres a tremendous opportunity for us to gain operating leverage from these platforms across the global generics market, especially in the Developed Markets. So very focused on growing our European business and Other Developed Markets at a faster pace through these strengths that we have established. And lastly, Id say that continued focus on the cost position across our network. The bulk of our business is still generics, and cost optimization has to be a consistent effort to drive profitability on the generic side of the business. Theres still tremendous opportunities. As much as we have gained a lot of efficiencies over the last 5 years, theres still a lot of opportunities that we have on the operational front, on the supply chain front, on the quality front, to be able to continue to improve our cost position as an organization. All of this is enabled by, number one, our focus in quality and compliance. We have an aspiration to be best in class in compliance. We were best in class 10 years ago, and theres no reason why we cant get to this goal in the next few years. We are exploring areas that we can leverage digital and AI to get more efficient, to get more creative as an organization. Its a big lever that is yet to unfold, yet to really conclude what areas make sense for us to double down. But we have embarked on 5 or 6 material areas where we believe we can make a material difference through AI as well as digital. And last and most importantly is our people’s strategy. I mean, all of what you have seen so far has been delivered by a very strong, committed team, and we continue to work on our team both developing our people internally as well as bringing in capabilities from the outside to compliment and drive growth going forward along with our internal team. So very strong areas of growth that we have identified for ourselves. Were very focused on each of these areas and are confident that we will continue to grow our business on a consistent basis in the years to come ahead. So with that, I will hand it over to Nilesh to walk us through a deeper review of the business.",

      "content": "Thank you, Nilesh. So friends, we are meeting after a gap of nearly three years. Obviously, this used to be an annual event. And we were very happy to meet everybody. But unfortunately, COVID actually put rest to that for some time. But glad to be back in action in that sense. But its not as though we have not been in touch. We obviously have been in touch, in continuous touch for that matter. We still continue with our roadshows. We meet with all of you on a one-on-one basis or in groups or in the various broking houses that conduct their meets.. So in that sense, we certainly have been in touch. Vinita and Nilesh, of course, focused a lot on FY25 and took you through the strategies that we have for the future. And of course, give you a glimpse of what we intend doing over the next five years and how we are going to achieve our goals. But Im just going to focus on, in fact, the current year, what have we done in this particular quarter. The momentum for the current quarter was, of course, set a few quarters ago. So the last seven to eight quarters have been a period of continuous growth. And thats reflected in the numbers that you see out here as well. This quarter, again, it is great growth across various markets. The good thing about Lupin is the fact that its been secular growth across all markets. And this has come about the kind of products that we have introduced, which, of course, youll see in the next couple of slides. Equally, there has been good performance across all markets. And of course, a lot of focus across various lines. Nilesh and Vinita spoke about various initiatives that we have taken and all of those have borne fruit. Talking about, in fact, this particular quarter, US, of course, we had Mirabegron. We also had other products, like Prednisolone, Rivaroxaban and of course, the inline products of Albuterol, Spiriva®, which delivered. If you talk about the advanced markets in Europe, U.K., Luforbec® continues to do pretty well and of course totalling up pretty good growth. India, this particular quarter, it was seemingly lacklustre but the fact of the matter is we lost exclusivity on a couple of products when it came to diabetes. And of course the respiratory portfolio, the overall market itself has not performed too well. But clearly, if you compare year on year, we have done pretty well there as well. API, of course, the full year, we have done extremely well. The GIB business in API, of course, has done extremely well as well but its a cyclical business in a general sense. The most important story is really on the EBITDA and the last several quarters, we have seen continuous growth. This particular quarter, we ended up at 23.2%, but this is after taking into account a couple of things. The first is, essentially, you would see a INR 100 crore increase when it comes to the R&D expenditure and there has been a decline in terms of PLI that we claimed for this quarter, which is about INR 50 odd crores. So if you would adjust for these two, the actual EBITDA margin would have been close to about 26%. And the other thing that you should certainly take into account is the fact that some of our adjacencies that we started in recent times are still making a loss. Obviously, its a question of time before they also evolve and grow in size in critical mass and of course, contribute to the overall profits. If you were to May 15, 2025 take that into account, that would actually be good another 3.7 % points. So clearly, the EBITDA margins are in line with, in fact, the rest of the competition, the peer group and we have caught on pretty well. For the full year, of course, done extremely well. Last years margins were close to about 19%. Full year FY25, we are moving it at 23.7%. Clearly, the momentum has been maintained and more to come, as Vinita and Nilesh were saying. Clearly, we learn from history and whilst we have come a long way, its also equally important to see the magnitude of change. Lupin peaked way back in 2017-18, when we had products like Fortamet® and Glumetza®, that was a time when the entire industry was also doing pretty well. Lupin is, of course, at its peak. Our market cap was close to about USD 13.5 billion, but since then, a lot of water has flown and you would recognize that the entire structure of the industry changed quite a bit. First, we had the enactment of GDUFA, which changed in lots of ways the industry because there were faster approvals. Second is of course, the channel consolidation which happened in America which of course set us back because it was stacked against the manufacturers. Then of course COVID which struck. We also had our own systemic problems in terms of our five of our facilities were under OAI status and because of that, we were not getting approvals. So whilst we had a pipeline of close to about 109 molecules, we unfortunately were not getting the approvals to launch them and to that extent, the top line was not moving. The actual movement started in 2021 when we got our approvals for Albuterol and since then, the mojo was back. In 2022, we actually brought in a couple of other products also Posaconazole was one of the products. Then of course Brovana®. Brovana® is what we launched in 2022. In 2023, we had products like Xopenex® which came in. We also had Suprep®. In 2024, we had Spiriva® and before that, we had Darunavir and this year of course we have Mirabegron. All of this has brought in a tremendous change when it comes in fact to the top line. But more importantly, what it did was also increasing the gross margins. The quality of the products, it went up over time. Whilst we bottomed at around 58.3, this is the time when we were actually plagued by failure to supply, penalties because of that and of course, returns in America because of Nitrosamine products. All of this was something that we addressed with the team thats out here. And since then, the margins have crept up. The gross margins are now moving up. In 2024, we saw it at 66%. And this year, we closed at 69.2%, big increase over the last several quarters. Whilst we focused on, in fact, the mojo on the top line, bringing in good products, we didnt lose sight of, the various lines across the entire P&L. And as the leaders were saying, theres a lot of work done on every line of the P&L. We looked at the gross margins, in terms of alternate vendor development, routes to synthesis, productivity across various lines in terms of R&D, in terms of manufacturing, in terms of our sales force. All of this actually resulted in fact the expenses that we brought in line. We also undertook a mission to actually bring down cost by close to about, INR 750 to INR 1,000 crores. Nilesh just mentioned the fact that there has been good success in that and we saw the numbers as well. And you could actually see, while in FY20, other operating expenses was about 30.4% and FY21 was the period when you had COVID and there was a reduction in terms of sales and promotion expenses. May 15, 2025 But since then, a lot of the measures that we took have brought these lines back to less than 30%, something that we committed to the investing community some time ago. A lot of emphasis on moving to more complex products and though of course the R&D spends have been increasing as a percentage of sales, it has actually been kept constant around, about 8%. Though of course, you might actually see an absolute numbers and as a percentage of sales going up over the next few years. As a result of all of this, obviously, the EBITDA margins have grown continuously. The analyst community would talk to us and talk about the fact that our margins were less than their peers but we have addressed that. And as I was just telling you, we were at 23.8%, thanks to all of this. And if I were to knock out the impact of, in fact, the adjacencies and one times and the like, obviously, things would be much more. Capital expenditure has been contained. We addressed the footprint and still addressing that as well. A lot of the capital expenditure has already been done, not too much actually happening out there. From that perspective, we also find the free cash flows increasing. Theres been a lot of focus on operating working capital. You know, some time ago, we were the darling of the crowd when we had working capital of less than about 96-97 days. It went up over a time because, we lost sight of that for a period of time. We have addressed this issue and the focus has brought us back to pretty good operating working capital. The operating working capital today is amongst the best in the industry at just about 110. And obviously, all of this is also in much larger free cash flows. We are talking about a figure of about INR 1,330 crores this particular year after taking into account all the amounts that we expended in terms of capital expenditure, the increase in working capital and also in terms of investments for the M&A that we have done. You would be happy to know that we are now a cash surplus company. The overall net debt of the company is virtually zero. The ability to actually raise monies and go for acquisitions is far superior right now. All of this is, resulted in much higher ROCEs, which has been climbing over time. Today, its a good 22%. Still a far cry from what we were about a few years ago. We were 27% - 28%. And its a question of time we get to those levels. We would be looking at M&A because clearly, thats something which is important from our perspective to grow our specialty business. And of course, the growth in India. But clearly, there is a lot of focus on ROCE. We started our ESG journey quite several years ago but we were not articulating that in terms of our annual report. But today, the last three years, weve been to be reporting a lot of stuff in the integrated report and you would find that we have made pretty good progress out there. In terms of various frameworks that are there in existence, we have actually done extremely well. On a DJSI score, we have scored a high of about 75, last year, which is amongst the top three in the industry. We have got a lot of accolades across various frameworks, EcoVadis, in terms of UNGC, in terms of TCFD and May 15, 2025 all of this is reflected in the various metrics that we keep publishing from time to time. In terms of our goals itself, the number of goals that weve taken for FY30. Theres a lot of focus because we are passionate about it. Wed like to actually look at a very differentiated way of presenting this and taking this as in terms of our responsibilities and done a pretty good job there. Some of these are actually mentioned out here. Weve done a lot of stuff when it comes to climate change with, a 23% reduction till date whilst the goal is about 38%. In terms of water, I think we are leading the industry out there. And in recycling, about 50% by FY30. Similarly, there are lot of other goals that we have set and this is something which is very important especially from a European perspective. Thank you, friends. And with that, I think we could just move on to the question-and-answer session.",

At present our Huminsulin® market share is 18%. We expect with this space becoming available we will be able to garner another 6-7% market share as far as Huminsulin® is concerned. So, that’s absolutely our strategic move as far as acquiring Huminsulin®. Semaglutide going off-patent as Vinita also mentioned in March 2026, we are developing in-house also Semaglutide and we have partnered with other partners also so we are very much ready once it goes LOE. And we expect that this market is going to go up because once the prices come down the usage is going to go up.",

And CNS neurology - with NaMuscla®, we are now doing the study to bring the product to US as well, that’s multiple times the opportunity of the current product. If we can get other neurology products, they will be synergistic with the infrastructure that we have in Europe as well as what we will build in the US. Those are still the two focus areas. Opportunistically we look at other areas as well based on the assets that come to market. Our focus is very much on accretive assets; on a limited basis we are looking at pipeline assets. On the pipeline front we obviously want de-risked pipelines, so late-stage programs and will want to look at creative structures around it to be able to mitigate the risk on our P&L.

We are also kind of prioritizing in terms of where we will be putting our money in and from our perspective it is going to be in India and of course specialty. Though we would of course like to address white spaces in distribution program across say geographies like Europe. And we have also said that when it comes to adjacencies, we would restrict our overall involvement to what we envisaged at the time of drawing up the investment program for various adjacencies. Beyond that we would actually involve private equity houses or a potentially strategic of the like. So, we also said in terms of financial returns we would be expecting return of about 20% and in terms of a payback period between 4 to 6 years depending upon the project.

But what we are doing with that platform is really exploring innovative opportunities, 505(b)(2) opportunities. We have put peptides on that platform. We are working on biologics on that platform to see how far we can extend the use of the platform. But to us the biggest opportunity with Nanomi is really the ability to innovate and build a novel pipeline. The Medisol acquisition and injectable business acquisition in France. We didn’t have a presence in France until we bought Medisol. So it gives us a presence in France. And on top of the portfolio we have there we are looking at all of the injectables that we have in India including Risperdal Consta® but we are looking at the broader portfolio of injectables to bring into France.",
