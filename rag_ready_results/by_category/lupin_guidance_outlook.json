      "content": "A very warm welcome to everybody out here; very happy to have you back, especially when the results are so good. Im sure youve already gone through the results and a lot of youve already spoken to me and asked me a lot of questions. Indeed, when we began the year, we said the first two quarters are going to be little lackluster, but we did promise that the third quarter and fourth quarters, youll see a remarkable turnaround and more than that, actually. And we lived up to our own expectations. This fourth quarter, we closed our accounts with a record turnover, over INR 4,000 crores, for this particular quarter. Ive been advised that there are people from abroad joining in, and we have a call. So lets wait for a few more minutes. There are several qualitative aspects to our turnover for the quarter, of course, there is a 9% growth for the full year, when we speak about the performance vis-à-vis the previous quarter that is 22% up, 34% up vis-à-vis the last year itself. While these are a good set of numbers, we are happier with the gross margins performance also; 74% for this particular quarter and if you look at the performance for the year, it is 68.7% while it’s even higher than in the last year. It goes to show the quality of the products we launched in the market fourth quarter. Of course, it follows through with the EBITDA margins - which for this quarter was 34% whilst for the full year it is still a tad lower than the last year, but I would attribute that a very high R&D expenditure over Rs.500 crores, which would have translated another 3 percentage points. If we add both, we come to EBITDA margins even higher than last year. Of course, the PBT, again, despite the fact that the R&D expenditure was high - was higher than last year and if not for that for the higher quantum of tax, the PAT itself would have been considerably high. And on that last note, may I request Dr. KKS to make the presentation? Dr. Kamal K Sharma: Good Evening, Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you, Ramesh for those opening remarks. You’ve already seen the results, and Ramesh gave you a snapshot of where the financials have worked out. I think, I’m going to walk you through some of the industry trends as they are mopping, and how does Lupin that come in the face of those trends, and finally look at the quick dive into the financials, and end by saying as to what we are going to be doing, in the coming years. So, when we speak about the trends, something which has been very prominent in the recent past, is the erosion in prices in the US. And as you are aware that there has been substantial consolidation of the channel partners, and therefore it has obviously helped them to improve their bargaining power and the differential price in that one could earlier enjoy that is no more there. So, there is a block price for a group of channel partners, and I think the last one which happened was recently was Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 McKesson and Walmart, right. So, that really has been -- you know, generally, the US market -- Generic market will experience about 4% to 5% price reduction, of which at least 50% one would be able to make up through operational efficiencies but this particular episode has led to double-digit reduction to the tune of 14-15%. Of course, what is positive, is a better score on approvals by FDA. There has been substantial improvement in that area which had hithered towards deficient. When it comes to India, we are all aware that NLEM has set a new order as far as the Indian business is concerned. And whatever was the impact of the first NLEM policy, there has been further reinforced with what has happened in 2015 and the latest one that we have been dealing with is the ban on fixed dosage combinations, there is a temporary respite for part of them because we have a stay order but how it’s going to pan out is anybody’s guess. In sum and substance, there is a pressure on the business in terms of control on prices and ability to launch new products. Japan - the government has been progressively working towards improving the penetration of Generics, it is targeting 70% by 2017 and 80% by 2020. But on the other side, Japanese administration is also pushing prices down, I think, earlier we used to experience reduction in price every two years, now it’s become an annual feature which is not a very good news. There has been substantial consolidation in the industry in the last 2.5-years; M&A of $500 billion has happened and most of you have been reading in the papers of the major mergers which have taken place in the recent past. Another development which is worth citing here is that Biosimilars which is kind of a new wave in Generic market. They are now seeing a lot of traction on the guidelines, pathways from the regulators in Europe and in America and hopefully in the next few years there would be a lot more clarity in taking these to the markets. There are already instances where US is approving Biosimilars for the market. The year witnessed a lot of penalties from USFDA on the manufacturing plants. And while we have had a stellar record, we did not escape the heat and we will talk about that. Coming specifically to United States. What is in store for us in terms of trends, is that the Generic penetration is expected to rise from the current 88% to 92%. Between now and 2020 there is likelihood of $92 billion worth of patent expiration, which is an opportunity in Generics. This obviously augurs very well for the business. We also understand that the lion share of Generic goes to oral solid dosage forms, and a lot more needs to be done in the alternative forms. And the generic industry despite all the consolidation that we keep hearing about and we keep witnessing remains very Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 fragmented and in that sense if you see the top five operators in generics in the United States have lost their contribution from 55% to 51%, market share has come down. This is what I will say, meaning, when I said that the dominant share is with the Oral Solid Dosage form, in the slide that we see on the screen, you would see that there are 47 players in the OSD whereas as you go to the right of the slide you would see that there are a lesser number of players and there is a lot of concentration in the hands of few. The idea of sharing this information with you is to say that there is a lot of scope to grow in alternative dosage forms other than OSD and that’s what, is the world of Complex Generics and specialty which we’re pursuing in the company. What does this trending mean for Lupin in particular? I think we’ve already started our journey towards Complex Generics, we need to focus on it a lot more, we need to build Specialty both internally as well as through acquisition and partnerships. In India, I think the way the trends are, if we are going to be controlled on new launches, if there’s going to be price pressure, I think, the alternative is to increase your prescriber base and as we have demonstrated in the past we need to create more alliances: a) we need to go deeper into the existing alliances, as I speak with you we have four alliances in India with multinationals, and whatever we are doing with them, we need to go deeper, in addition, b) we need to tie up with more partners, so that the growth is ensured. Likewise in Japan, I think if one wants to deal with the price pressure, the only way it can be done is to launch more products and -- in order to do that I think we need to seek more strategic partnerships and of course we are already undertaking capacity expansion in Japan to be able to serve the market better. As far as M&A is concerned, I think we have stated in the past and our policy remains as we have said in earlier that Lupin would look at select areas of brand and specialty and niche technology platforms when it comes to merger and acquisitions. We’ve also stated earlier about our geographic expansion endeavor and I must say that in future you might witness some bolt-on acquisition, but by and large, as far as the geographic expansion is concerned for the company, we seem to be there, I think what we need to do is really now make these new acquisitions grow and consolidate them rather than expand geographically any further. Derived from the focus on Complex Generics and Specialty, I think it is a natural corollary that the R&D investments have to get enhanced in Complex Generics and the Specialty area and also in Biologics and you already see that escalation happening as we will discuss the financials. Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 As far as the execution is concerned, I think we’ve always revered for flawless execution and operational excellence is one of the key drivers of our effort there. We want to make sure that we are cost leaders in whatever we do. And that brings me to sharing with you, what we have been sharing in the past too as to how we see Lupin mopping, from a Generic - Branded Generic Company till now into Complex Generics, Specialty Company going forward and the share of Complex Generics and Specialty has to increase with the Generic component of the business. Generic would always remain a very lion piece of the business, as you know that, at any given time, very large part of illness is served by patent expired drugs. So one cannot do with that but larger attention would be received by Specialty and Complex Generics in our business. So that’s about the trends that we are kind of witnessing in the industry. In the face of those trends, I think its worthwhile looking at how Lupin stacks up to this challenge. I think one feels very proud to share journey of last 10-years with the audience here. It has been a stellar performance by any standards. If you look at the market capitalization, I think, there’s a compounded annual growth rate of 32% from kind of Rs.41 billion to Rs.667 billion. Revenues have registered a growth of 24% in the same period. R&D expenditure has also gone up with 31% growth and this is something which -- you know, R&D is a key driver of our business endeavor in Pharmaceuticals and therefore requisitely we’ve been investing in the priority areas in R&D. What is most heartening is the quality of our business where you see our EBITDA margins growing at annual compounded rate of growth 29%. There were times when we were struggling around the 10% and you know 18-19% for a long time. We’ve crossed that barrier and we are now around 30%. Likewise, net profit also has shown very promising growth of 29%. So that speaks about the way we have organizationally strengthened our company. As a consequence of that, we are today 7th Largest Generic Company Globally by Market Cap, 9th Largest Company by Revenues, we are the Third Largest Indian Pharma Company by Global Sales, #1 Anti-TB Company which is our Legacy business, we are the 5th Largest Company in the United States by Prescriptions; we have a prescription share of 5.6-5.7%, we are the 9th Largest Generic Company in Japan, 8th Largest Indian Pharma Company and the 4th Largest Generic Company in South Africa and #1 Cardiovascular Company in South Africa. With the good work that the team has done, it has brought along the accolades that the team deserves. The notable ones, that I may mention here in the long list that is in front of you, is being designated as Outstanding Company of the Year by CNBC- TV18, Lupin was ranked as “15th Best Place to Work for in Asia” by Great Places to Work Institute, we have been ranked as one of the best employer of 2016 in India by Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 AON. Vinita Gupta and Nilesh were awarded the Entrepreneur of the year award by Ernst & Young. Vinita has been in the focus for various awards, as you can see the list there and I think the notable one has been the Power 50 Women in Business and last but not the least is Ramesh Swaminathan who has been recognized as The Best CFO by FinanceAsia. When we speak about Lupin today and how it stacks up against the trends and the challenges that I shared in the beginning of the presentation, I think what we are doing with our head down as a team in the company, is to build a global footprint for the company, both through the internal development of capabilities as well as acquiring capabilities from the outside through M&A, wherever we feel either the lead times are going to be very long or we just don’t have the wherewithal from within to build those capabilities. And in that regard, you would see here, that we have set up a state-of-the-art R&D facility in Florida for Inhalation, we have our first Biosimilar order for Pune facility getting into Phase-III Etanercept, we had a stellar launch of Glumetza and a lot of positive movement that we are seeing today is because of that and we hope to continue to do launches like that in future too. On the Inorganic side, we used to hold 60% equity in the South African company, is now 100% ours, so we acquired the 40% remaining equity from the erstwhile promoter, we have acquired a business in Brazil Medquimica, we have acquired Gavis which is our largest acquisition and one of the largest out of India, we also acquired a small CNS portfolio in Germany called Temmler. We’ve always said that you know our inorganic play would be not to chase size but to chase quality. And I think that’s what the slide here would show you that of the entire growth story that Lupin has experienced, 20% of our revenue comes out of inorganic endeavors or inorganic interventions and 80% of that is really our organic effort. So that speaks for the team, as to how well integrated they have been, in terms of achieving the kind of target that we had set for ourselves, which have always been very stretched. And I think another highlight of the journey is that whatever we acquire along the way that too has grown extremely well. So if you see Kyowa that we acquired in October 2007 has registered a compounded annual growth rate of 16% on constant foreign exchange. Likewise the South African asset Pharma Dynamics has grown 25% in the period. So, that shows that whatever we acquired has also been producing results and growing at a very healthy clip. Gavis which is now called Lupin Somerset is our biggest and by far the latest acquisition. And while we were kind of endeavoring to have it by mid of last year, but we could close it only towards the early part of this year, but what is important is that performance is on track, the integration is complete, we have a new leader there, who is an extremely competent person and we hope that whatever we have planned, Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 in terms of tripling the turnover of Lupin Somerset from the time of acquisition, we will definitely be hitting the bull’s eye there. What is even more interesting to share with you that in the portfolio of Gavis, we could get to reach for our Branded business. You know that we are very proud of our Branded business, but for various reasons it had been going down because we lost intellectual property rights on a particular product, it became Generic on Suprax, but these two new leads - one on Methergine which is for Women’s Health and other one, you know, methylphenidate chewable tablets for the Pediatric ADHD indication is giving a new lead to our Branded business and also gives us little more time to really push hard in terms of other efforts that we have been making in building that business. I think you are all aware that in terms of net effect of Gavis on Lupin’s portfolio it has added 28 products to our marketed products, so total 124 products are there in the market today. There are 9 controlled substances and 01 dermatology product out of this basket. There are about 102 cumulative filings, of which 58 are pending and additional 66 products are under development. Lupin has a good score in terms of our total filings; now we have filed, between Lupin and Lupin-Somerset that is our new facility, Gavis, 343 filings, of which 180 have been approved and balance are awaiting approval. What has been more heartening, is that we have total 256 products under development between the two facilities. So that should give you an idea as to how the future is going to pan out with this rich pipeline of products which is getting ready, with 163 awaiting approval and 256 getting into the pipeline. We have spoken about our journey. I think we have been continuously traversing this nexus of complexity where our risk will slightly go up but rewards will substantially go up and you know in business where you have risk, you have rewards. And if you see the chart in front of you, you would see that our journey is defined in the chart starting with Oral Contraceptives. On the right hand side of the chart, you see the total market potential that one is trying to address through this effort and on the left you see the various components of this effort that together constitute riding the wave of complexity as far as the business is concerned. Starting with Oral Contraceptives where we have 21 products in the market, 10 are pending approval. Moving on to Ophthalmology, where we have 2 products in the market, 7 filings are awaiting approval and there are more developments happening; Dermatology, as I said a while ago, we have 1 product from Gavis portfolio and 24 filings, further development is ongoing. And on to Controlled Substances, which is again a very cohesive area for business and we started making efforts in Injectables Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 last two years. We acquired a R&D facility in Netherlands in the name of Nanomi and between LRP, that is Pune facility and Nanomi, will be developing a set of Complex Injectables. We set up this R&D for Inhalation in Florida, which has already made 2 filings; 1 MDI is under clinical trial and we hope to commence trial of the DPI device during this year. And then of course we have a Biosimilars program in India, where we have 10 products under development and one of them Etanercept is entering Phase-III for Japan. And of course, we have a program on new drug discovery where we have 10 new chemical entities, 4 of them are in clinical trials currently. Talking about Global Footprint: I think very rightly we have today manufacturing facilities, 12 sites in India, 2 in Japan, 1 in United States, 1 in Mexico and 1 in Brazil. We also have a research facility in Pune in India. Also, a small research facility in Aurangabad to augment the Generic development. We have research facilities in Japan, one for Injectable, one for Oral Solid Dosage. We have R&D facilities in Somerset and we have also small R&D facilities in Mexico and in Brazil and of course Nanomi in Netherlands. So that’s truly the mark of a global footprint where we have multiple manufacturing organization and multiple research facility to really pool into overall effort of moving up the complexity chain and reaching our target that we have set for ourselves. I said in the beginning that the rigor of inspections have gone up from FDA, for good reasons, at the same time, I think -- for example, - last one year we have faced about 12, so -- and there have been times when two sites are being inspected at the same time, so that would just tell you as to how much extra vigilance is happening in - on this count. We have had a very good record as far as compliance is concerned since 2009, but in the recent past, yes, we also face the heat as I mentioned earlier. The major among these observation has been only Goa where we had a repeat inspection from the FDA, we have responded to the observations and we have provided an update thereafter which is kind of in regular good order and we are now working for a holistic transformation. In a matter of speaking, the transformation is never complete here because the goal post keeps changing, so you have to continuously work to keep on the effort and if at all there is any failing, it is our own failing to live up to certain speed of the target changing. From time to time the prescription from the FDA undergo change, the new employees come, the training needs - need to be augmented and therefore there are times when one has challenges to face, but we are very confident that we are going to be able to deal with it like we did it in the past in 2009. So that, kind of gives you a snapshot of how Lupin today stacks up to the trends and the challenges, as are presented to work in the industry. Now, a quick Business Update for you: Ramesh has already shared this with you, you have the results with you I think, Q4 has been an epoch making quarter for us. It is a record turnover of Rs.4,000 crores plus and a record net profit of Rs.800 crores Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 plus. Obviously, this is riding on major contribution from United States apart from other geographies like India and Japan which have also turned out very good performance. In fact, what is heartening about Lupin is that all geographies have turned out good performance, notwithstanding FOREX pressure in the emerging markets where the local currency has been depreciating, but since US is a lion share of our revenue, obviously, what happens in the US affects our overall results rather more penetratingly either in other geographies. In terms of the annual results, as you know that we started off last year, the first two quarters were under challenge. We spoke about the price pressures in America, we spoke about the NLEM effect you know the price reduction there and in face of all that, we never had any new products in the first two quarters, so one of the ways to combat pressures of prices is really to be able to launch new products, but unfortunately, we had pretty dry spell in the first two quarters, it was from Q3 onwards that we started, you know, getting better; we did a reasonable job in the Q3, but Q4 has been fantastic. Overall, the year witnessed a very moderate growth of 8.7 % in the top line. The net profit appears like recording slight decline of 5.5%; however, we maintain the PBT despite a severe hike in our R&D expenditure. As Ramesh was mentioning to you that this 28.8% EBITDA that you see here is, you give cognizance of the Rs.500 crores extra expenditure that we have done in R&D which is again done for the future, so there is no concern on that account because this is all going towards building IP for the future in terms of clinical development product, but just for the sake of a perspective, if that were to not to be spent, the EBITDA margin will be 32.4%, as against 30.6% of previous year, that will all flow into the PBT line. Adding to that with our unsold inventory and the tax paid on that, our tax rate has been 5% higher than previous year. So all that put together, reflects into what you see is the net bottom line of the company. It is not to justify, it is just to share with you some of the real happenings in the business. Now, talking about some of the Major Geographies -- US: The overall business has shown a growth on corresponding quarter as well as on sequential quarters; 54%. And, this is all in dollar terms as you see on your screen. And as I mentioned that because the first two quarters were absolutely dry for a new product and we’ve done a lot of bucking up in the Q3 and Q4, the year ended up in US as flat. However, there have been some remarkable achievements in the US, as you know that Lupin is a supplier of four of the top ten most commonly dispensed products in United States, we are #5 by Prescription in the US, we have a very handsome pipeline of products as we spoke a while ago with 343 ANDA filings, of which, you know, 180 are approved and Somerset facility has substantially added to that particular portfolio. Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 We had 39 approvals during the year, of which 25 were for Lupin and 14 from Lupin Somerset.",

      "content": "Despite all the pressures has grown 6% over the year. It is 9th largest generic company. You know that it’s a strong company in CNS, Cardiovascular, and Gastroenterology. We’re actually building a new dedicated site for Oral Solid Dosage, also there is a new Injectable line coming up in Japan. In Japan, it is material to have a relationship with national distributors, 4 of them, we have recently got into an alliance with one of the national distributors, we only do some business with 2 of them I think we are now trying to expend on our exposure at the national level. This should augur very well for the company in terms of getting a larger share of the distribution piece. In the rest of the businesses also, as I said, Lupin always has this positive side that we are able to have a secular growth in all our markets. And this is even more meaningful here that what you see on the slide that whatever you see here is despite a pressure on the foreign exchange devaluation in most of the emerging markets. South Africa business has grown 10%, it is the Fourth Largest Generic Company as I mentioned earlier and the #1 Cardiovascular Company. Philippines had a fantastic record of growth of 42% as against industry growth of 9% and is ranked 22nd. Latin America- our Mexican company Lab Grin is the 2nd Largest Ophthal Company by Volume but the 4th largest by revenue. And Brazil, which is Medquimica, is rather new in our system, so we have just to see as to how it mops up, we obviously have plans to grow that business. Europe did well this time; Hormosan, which had been giving us some concerns at times was rather going up and down, we definitely see very clear signs of turning around, it’s now making profit and as I mentioned earlier, Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 we also have acquired a company Temmler which adds to the CNS portfolio of Germany. API business is the strong pillar for Lupin because it feeds all our formulation endeavors. We’ve had a certain slowness in the growth because we have an old portfolio but a lot of new initiatives have been taken in API in terms of adding new line of therapy, new line of APIs, those are going to mop over next two to three years. What is even more heartening that now the API business is going to participate in advanced markets, as you see here, there are 172 US DMF filings, 16 of which were made in this particular year and once they come up, you obviously see a high quality business being added to this portfolio, so that should augur extremely well for the API business of the company. I think we have spoken about R&D that as we move up the complexity curve, I think there is little choice, but to put in more money in R&D, because as you get into the world of Complex Generics and Specialty, Biosimilars, New Drug Discovery of course, there is a lot more clinical development that we have to do and that takes in a lot of money. So as you would see that over last year -- in this year- our R&D expense has gone up by 3%. Just in Q4, the R&D investment was 12.5% of our sales, but you also saw the pipeline that we are developing for future and it takes all that to really be able to bring that to reality. At the same time, I think one is very conscious of the fact that when we are investing in R&D, we need to make sure that our research pipeline really delivers. We continue to invest a lot of money and time in building a good pool of people in addition to what we have in India, as you know now, we have also very strong R&D in United States and the other geographies, where we today have acquired businesses. We’ve already shared the pipeline, so I’m not going to repeat that here. So, having looked at the industry trends, having shared with you as to how does Lupin stack up to those trends, then a quick pen picture of how the financials have come through over the time is now you know - is now to leave you with what are we going to be doing in the company and you see some of the key buckets here for our future endeavors. Very clearly, in Generics, I think we have to grow US and Japan by new launches and grow base business, increase penetration in emerging markets, that’s very clearly the objective. When it comes to Specialty, we have to continue and reinforce our effort to build Specialty both organically as well as inorganically and we are in the process of building a Specialty pipeline. As far as R&D is concerned, I think the task is cut out because in Pharmaceuticals business there are two drivers - key drivers of the business. I sometimes like to add the third one. The R&D on one hand, Marketing the second and maybe Operational Excellence which becomes overriding, rest everything else is a Service function if you really look at Pharma. So R&D is a Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 lifeline of our business and we will continue to deliver on the pipeline and we will evolve the Complex Generics and Specialty pipeline over time, the effort has already started showing up, you will see that in coming quarters. I said that a while ago Operational Excellence, Cost Leadership, High Efficiency, Optimal Time Cycles is the order of the day. You have to remain lean and I think that’s what our endeavor is as far as operational excellence is concerned. Compliance is going to remain a major challenge in our business and we all understand that if you’ve hooked for non- compliance, what it can cost you and therefore that would always remain an area of high interest. With that, I come to an end of my presentation. Thank you very much. I think we can now take questions and we will deal with the questions as they come. Do you have some? Okay, Alpesh is saying that we will have questions from the live audience and alternatively also with the connected audience.",

So good part of growth for fiscal year ’17 is our existing portfolio and then the new product, we certainly are looking forward to new product approvals despite our challenges at Goa, we hope to be able to resolve the 483 with FDA. Proactively we have started tech transferring the materials products that we expect to launch in fiscal year ’17 to our other approved sites to Indore to Aurangabad and to Somerset. Then, we go through the Gavis portfolio, then we have a very nice site - Generic portfolio that we have added in March with the acquisition of Gavis, we see the potential of expanding share on the Generic side of the portfolio, Gavis had a reasonable share but we have stronger reach, stronger relationship with the customers, that should enable us to expand share. And lastly, the growth on the Brand side of the business, the last year - last -- last year was really challenging for our Brand business, we saw Generic Suprax right at the start of the year - you know in April that for us our whole Brand business down significantly to $45 million this last year. When this year with the restructuring of our commercial infrastructure plus the addition of two products - our Gavis and particular Methergine - we see the Brand business getting back to a reasonable level of revenues. We had two products as Dr. Sharma mentioned Methergine and chewable Methylphenidate that Gavis was sole source on that we believe could benefit from promotion. So, we took our sales force 120 people from Pediatric, Primary Care split to Pediatric Women’s Health and Primary Care and have started calling on the hospitals of kinds with Methergine, and they have got very good initial response. Likewise, we added Methylphenidate, chewable Methylphenidate source on to the Brand side, the Pediatric portfolio and have started promoting in and again we started seeing a ramp up scripts with chewable Methylphenidate. So really I mean a lot of our growth focus is the products that we have launched in the last year, the products that we have acquired and there is opportunity on the Brand side of the business that we leverage out of the Gavis portfolio and new products additions out of India as well as of Somerset.",

We are also getting deeper into the investments on innovation, so we have at least two clinical trials that will begin in the financial year, we are deeper in Dermatology, we are deeper in Biosimilars, so we expect to pretty much complete the intensive clinical trials in the financial year and then we are investing in Drug Discovery as well. So all of this together, probably IS going to take it somewhere between the 12-15% -- within 15% likely more than 12% in terms of R&D spends.",

Obviously, we have got to stay at this point, we don’t know how things will transpire and what timeframe they transpire in but the Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 government is slowly talking about more products coming under an FDC ban as well. Amongst all of this so there’s lots of challenges, but as you saw in Q4 we added 1,000 reps, we added 5 divisions, we still see growth coming out of India, and my estimate is that in FY’17 we will probably grow by 15% again.",

They have good number of applications that they’ve got approval for the past year, not all of which have been launched, so we expect this year to be a significant year out of Somerset for the organization. On the longer-term aspiration that we have shared you know the fiscal year ’18 aspiration now it doesn’t look like it’s that long-term, it’s year -- next year after this fiscal year we believe based on the initiatives that we have executed on the acquisitions that we have made organic growth efforts, the pipeline that we have for the US, Japan, India, other parts of the world that we can get to $3.5 million or thereabout, I mean, our aspiration was certainly to get to $5 billion but we think based on the current market scenario in the US on the Generic side of the business, based on what we have seen in the emerging market with currencies that we will likely get to $3.5 million where we sit right now. Of course, as we continue to work on other inorganic efforts in particular to build a Specialty business, first, that is what we - what we see right now, we still have an aspiration to grow beyond that, but we think it’s probably till we -- may be a year after or 2-years be on fiscal year ’18, and like Dr. Sharma said that we have never been on the mind set of acquiring to gain scale, you know, our effort has been to gain capabilities and strategically to our Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 business, we will continue to be focused on driving efforts both organically and inorganically to get to that $5 billion number as soon as we can, but through efforts that - that meet our strategy - that fit our strategy.",

So, I would personally be very disappointed if we don’t license out in FY- ’18, but the goal that we’re seeing right now is to still try and license out in FY-’17.

      "content": "Good afternoon, friends. Its my pleasure to welcome you to this Q2 Earnings Call. With me, I have Nilesh, Vinita, Ramesh, Arvind, Rajiv, Sunil and Naresh. As you would have seen from the results, the performance in the quarter has been good. We have done better than last quarter on a sequential basis. The top-line has seen a growth of 2% and the bottom-line, interestingly, has seen an improvement of 27%, -- although there is a decline of 8% on the revenue line on the corresponding basis and a 31% decline on the on the profit, which is in line with what we had been indicating earlier that there is a pressure on business in the U.S., primarily on account of consolidation of the trade partners and price reductions. But what is heartening about Lupin is that we have shown a very good growth in other segments of our business. As you know, US of course is a major driver of our profit and growth because it is about 35%. But India, which is about 30% of our revenues, has shown a growth of 24%. EMEA, again, has recorded a very good performance at about 22%-23%. APAC, likewise, has shown a growth of about 6% or so. So thats something very characteristic about Lupin that only in the market in US where there is a general sense of overall, kind of, I would say, headwinds in terms of business that we have been under pressure. Otherwise, in every other segment of our business, we have done very well. And also, I think what is interesting and what is noteworthy is that our operational efficiencies have been improving and there is a concerted effort to get them on track and even better. As you would notice from manufacturing expenses which have gone down and also from R&D investment that we have been calibrating, in no way we are sacrificing on any of our projects, but we have been calibrating our expenses and making sure that we do not exceed what we have intended to do. Having said that, I think we continue to work on our strategy to implement a growth path on complex generics, biosimilars and specialty. You will hear a lot more from Vinita on our forays in specialty that we have been building on and we are committed to build it further. With that, I will hand over the call to Ramesh to give you a financial pen picture for the business and then we will open the floor for Q&A. Thank you very much.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Sharma. So friends, we heard Dr. Sharma speak about the fact that we did particularly well this particular quarter vis-à-vis in fact the previous quarter. Lupin Limited October 30, 2017 To give more color on that, US declined by about 15% principally because of, pricing pressure and of course because of loss of exclusivity continuing on Glumetza and Fortamet. India did spectacularly well at 24.3%. APAC is also growing at 6.1%. Philippines, growing at 44%. EMEA growing by 22.1% including South Africa growing at 29%. Germany is also growing at 13.4%. Latin America vis-à-vis the previous quarter grew by 9.9%. But vis-à-vis previous year again Latin America is growing at 41.5%. Mexico a stupendous 66.2% and Brazil by 30.1%. vis-à-vis the previous year. We have done really well across various regions. EMEA grew by 17.1%, APAC grew by 15.2%. India vis-à-vis last year was 16.4%. But of course, the decline was principally in the US itself. In terms of EBITDA margins, at the beginning of the year we talked about a range of about 21% to 23%. Im very pleased to present that we were able to maintain about 23.9% for this particular quarter. So of course, we were aided by tailwinds in terms of FOREX and R&D spends itself were lower at 12.2% of sales. And then, as Nilesh promised, our R&D figure is going to be in the Rs 500 crores range on a quarterly run rate basis. There are couple of things which are actually disconcerting, essentially the working capital.As you would have noticed, it has gone up during the course of this particular quarter. But we do know that we have taken active taken steps to bring it down and we would see results coming in Q3 and Q4. Whilst I was speaking to some of you in the course of last couple of hours, you wanted to know more about what the guidance would be for the next two quarters. We believe that the sales have hit the bottom and we would do better in the next 2 quarters. With that, I would like to open the floor for discussions.",

So majority of our acquisition investment focus is to build the specialty side of the business in the US as well as Japan and Europe. And we look opportunistically at investment opportunities on the generic front, but we feel like we are very well set on the generic front with the capabilities that we have. And we believe, what is essential on a genetic front is to really evolve this complex generic pipeline as opposed to doubling down or getting larger with more volatile portfolio. So our focus is on the generic front is very much on building the complex generic pipeline.",

We expect to complete the Phase-III trial with Spiriva this fiscal year and file soon after and continue to work on other inhalation products. Our Advair development, we had additional studies that we needed to do. So that has taken us a little bit longer and then we have other MDI products that we are pursuing on the inhalation front. In terms of the guidance from the FDA, they have said that they are going to be very open to pre-filing meetings, mid-cycle reviews. So really more transparency, more communication around the inhalation products and we really welcome that; the industry welcomes that. But given that we have invested a lot on inhalation front, we expect to be at the forefront of engaging in a dialog with the FDA to try to get these products approved sooner rather than later.",

As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing ‘*’ then ‘0’ on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to the Lupin management. Thank you and over to you, sir. Dr. Kamal Sharma: Hello, good afternoon, friends. This is Kamal Sharma. I have with me the entire top management team; I have Vinita Gupta, Nilesh Gupta, Ramesh Swaminathan, Rajeev Sibal, Naresh Gupta, Sunil Makharia, Rajiv Pillai and Arvind Bothra - Head of Investor Relations. You already have seen the results for the quarter. I think it is a very unhappy situation for us, we are not happy at all with the results, but the real-life situation is such. While we had been contemplating that things are not going well with the generic business in US, there have been some surprises which were beyond us. Aside from that, Japan has not turned out well because the volumes have gone up but the biennial pricing cuts has depressed value performance in that place. Having said that, there has been good performance in India across both formulations and API. Germany has done well. South Africa has done very well but obviously the salience which the US and Japan have in our overall business tells on the results as you would have seen. Going forward, it looks like the situation is going to be similar for a few more quarters. We have some green shoots in the second half of this year but see much better performance from the second half of next year. This is what we see today and hopefully some of the other efficiency improvement measures will also add to value creation. With that, I will hand it over to our CFO, Mr. Swaminathan, to take you through the details. Thank you",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Sharma. Friends, whilst we are disappointed with the results, we do believe that better days are ahead of us at least in the second quarter. I have spoken to a lot of investors since yesterday afternoon and the questions hovered around our run rate in the US and our overall margins itself. I just want to clarify that at the outset, when it comes to the US, there has been a decline in our overall turnover and some people did comment about the fact that it was less than US$200 million for the first time in the last couple of years. This is for three reasons: Firstly, the overall Metformin franchise itself has eroded a bit. Secondly, the flu season is over and accordingly Tamiflu and other anti-infective sales were lower. Finally, Methergine went generic, for which we enjoyed brand status for some time. But having said all that, we do believe that the second quarter to come would certainly be much better. Lupin Limited August 09, 2018 The second half would be much better because the launches that we are bringing to the market include Levothyroxine, Ranexa, and we do believe that Solosec would certainly ramp up. So, for these reasons I think, as Dr. Sharma was saying that there are green shoots in the offering. In terms of the EBITDA margins, you must be aware of the fact that we are working with top consultants to actually ramp it up over time. We are working on several initiatives and we do believe our business will certainly improve over the next several quarters. With that, I would like to open the floor for discussions.",

We have data now for the last six weeks and week after week the scrips have ramped up nicely, ahead of our expectations in fact.

We have also seen very little resistance or reluctance on the part of physicians and the practitioners to write the product, so the introduction to the product has been very strong and the formulary coverage that our team has been able to get us, has also been very promising. When we launched the product, we had 50% coverage on commercial plants, at this point it is at 68% and our target is to be at (+80%) by the end of this year. So, I would say that given the momentum right now, we believe that we should be able to exceed our internal expectations of the product, but again early days.

We determined that it does not make sense to really pursue new products if you are going to see six, seven, eight players going forward. So we rationalized spend on the generic front in favor of products that have limited competition like inhalation products, complex injectables and others. So, this really helped us to start creating room for specialty R&D spends and we started building a pipeline. On the Specialty front, we are right now looking at other opportunities to add to our portfolio and our focus still is on late stage products that have gone through phase-3 trials. There are some other interesting opportunities that we are also looking at right now that need to complete phase-3 studies.

These are the same challenges that people are seeing right now in Japan. For our part, obviously, the move was how much more research we can do in India, how much more manufacturing we can do in India, what do we do with the sales force, and also Lupin Limited August 09, 2018 the move to specialty. So, we started with long listed, but even long listed products are not protected anymore. We have Bipresso on the Specialty side, but the intention would be to do more of complex generics and specialty in Japan as well. So, while Japan makes money, it is going through quite a bit of transition.

It was a difficult year last year as well, but the turbulence still continues in some ways, though there are green shoots visible. The good thing about this particular quarter was that there was sequential growth visible across all our major markets. We saw growth in America, Japan, Philippines, South Africa and India for sure. In the larger picture, it was also aided by very favorable forex tailwinds that contributed tremendously and thats one good reason why we saw improvement on the gross margin front. This cascaded to the EBITDA front also, however there was an impact of forex on the expenses front as well. To that extent the gross margin increase was pared down as it came down to the EBITDA level. Lupin Limited October 31, 2018 On another front, we continue to spend on Solosec because these are still early days. We spent about US$12 - $13 million this quarter, in addition to the US $12-$13 million that we spent in the first quarter. This obviously impacts the EBITDA, and you would notice that the EBITDA improvement is despite the fact that we have had this increase on that score. We do expect the second half of the year to be better. Its going to be aided by the fact that we could have the gRanexa launch, potential ramp up on Solosec and the onset of the flu season. Its also pertinent to talk about the EBITDA improvement measures that we have been undertaking. A lot of emphasis today is on cost cutting, because thats something which is in our hands. We on the previous occasions, spoke about the fact that we are working with world-class consultants to bring a lot of improvements on that score. A lot of progress has been made on that front in the last 5 months, but the results are yet to unfold. Its still early days, but we do expect that it will come through over time. We are working on procurement excellence - on the manufacturing front and various components out there, and on R&D productivity. We are very confident that there will be results coming in over the next several quarters. One last word on the effective tax rate, because after the results people have been calling me and asking me why the effective tax rate for the first half is very high. It’s because that there are losses in some of our subsidiaries. Whilst we pay a normal 26% tax in India, we have losses in other subsidiaries which should compress the overall PBT and thats why you will find the tax rate to be shooting up. With that I would hand it over to Vinita to say a few words about the American market.",

      "content": "Sure. As Ramesh and Dr. Sharma have already covered the overall revenue and profit performance, I would add on the US front. We saw 5% QoQ growth this quarter aided by forex of course, but also the base business grew 3% in local currency terms led by the generic business. The brand business witnessed some pressure, as you would recall in the last quarter we had a generic to Methergine that fully played out in Q2. So, the brand business was rather down QoQ, while the generic business was up primarily led by existing products, as we really didnt have any material new product launch during the quarter. It was primarily based on additional business that we picked up as a result of some supply-chain issues of peers and we are seeing more and more of these situations. Its actually a healthy sign as far as we are concerned. The US market is gone through a lot of pressure over the last couple of years, but we are starting to see some level of stabilization and moderation in price erosion setting in. In the last year or so, we have seen companies like Mylan, Teva get out of multiple products in their portfolio presumably because they had reached a threshold below which it was not feasible for them to continue to manufacture the product. So, we are seeing this supply disruption more and more which is a very healthy sign for the industry. We benefited from some of that in Q2 and we expect to continue to see this trend in the next couple of quarters. So, that plus the price moderation on the generic front, the upcoming flu season coupled with key launches in Q4 should help us grow our US business in the coming quarters. With the flu season coming up, we Lupin Limited October 31, 2018 expect the Tamiflu franchise as well as the cephalosporin franchise to contribute more in Q3 and Q4. And with Ranexa as well as Levothyroxine, we would expect good contribution in Q4. On the brand side of the business while Q1 and Q2 have been significant investments, we have seen a good ramp up in Solosec both in terms of prescriptions as well as managed care access, up now to 68% of unrestricted access and 90% plus overall access with some restrictions. This has been really positive, very encouraging for us to see this kind of access for the product this early in ramp up, early in the evolution. So we expect Solosec also to contribute more to our revenues in Q3 and Q4 as well as see the full-year impact in the next fiscal year. With that I would like to open it up to questions.",

However, they are already guiding to another price cut next year. So it’s really a fairly anti-generic environment. But in the broader picture, we are No. 6, and we have a very strong CNS focus. I think increasingly this is the market thats going to work for vertically integrated players, some of the stuff that we have already done - R&D in Lupin Limited October 31, 2018 India, manufacturing in India, vertical integration. I think those are the things that are going to work. We had the long-listed products that used to not see price cuts, now we see deep price cuts on the long-listed side as well. So, these are all things that are impacting the market. So, the market was not really perfect from that perspective. Its becoming more a generic oriented market, it is becoming a more substitution-oriented market where you dont need that much of promotion to doctors as well. So, it’s starting to switch into a more generic-generic kind of market. I think that is the outlook for the market, I dont think the market itself is going to change. So we have two parts - One part is the portfolio that we bring, primarily out of India including some of the complex generic products for Japan as well. The second part was the specialty play as we launched Bipresso. A good part of the sales force is really working on Bipresso at this point of time. Its early days, the numbers are still small but we hope to pick it up to be a meaningful number. We also have the biosimilar strategy playing out, so we have filed Etanercept. We had queries, we have responded to the queries as well and we are on track for launching it in the middle of next year and we are preparing for the launch.",

All our major therapy areas which are cardiac, anti-diabetics as well as respiratory we have been growing better than the market.

What our team tells me it takes roughly four to six months for the physicians to start listening to the reps and start to adopt the product and start writing the product and then once they see benefit to the patients, you will see the repeat writers. What we are finding is that we already have a good percentage of repeat physicians. So, the feedback that we have got is that the physicians that are utilizing the product is seeing benefit to the patient, that is why they are willing to write more of it. We just need to do more of it. We will get you the exact number of physicians and the details offline, Sameer, but I expect that in the next couple of months we should start seeing a larger prescribing base as well as repeat prescribers.",

The idea here was to go and materially look at the entire cost base, to look at every cost center and then define it. So, we are still in the midst of that program. It will be a couple of quarters before we get to final kind of plan, and then we have to execute, there is a lot of droppage in this plan, then there will be additions over time as well. The intent is to meaningfully resize the organization, resize investments in line with the strategy going forward and that of course takes a little bit of time. On the R&D also, I do not think we are giving up on any of the opportunities that we have and again that is market reality, instead of chasing 25, 30 oral solids, we are now chasing 18, 20 oral solids. So, you are certainly getting away from the numbers more to the quality, focusing more on the complex investments, whether it’s inhalation, or injectables or biosimilars. So, it is repurposing some of that. Over a period of time we love to add more into the specialty. So, we do not know right now whether that will be an increase in the R&D spend or whether we will be able to carve it out enough of the existing itself. But in the near-term, it stays at this level without losing out any meaningful opportunity. Lupin Limited October 31, 2018",

Now with Ranexa in our portfolio, we are launching it in the next couple of weeks. Levothyroxine will be launched later in this quarter in March. So very little of Levothyroxine sales in this quarter, but next quarter onwards and the next full year, we should have the full impact of Levothyroxine sales actually ramping up as we get approval against the other two RLDs on the bioequivalence. So on the generic side of the business, of course, Ranexa is exclusive for a short period of time. After that we expect Levothyroxine to fuel the generic business growth, and then later in the year we also expect ProAir to get approved hopefully. Once we get ProAir approved, we expect to launch it later in the year. Really the generic business has turned the corner this past quarter and with the near-term growth drivers, along with other smaller launches - we are looking at 20 launches next year, we should be able to grow the Generic business.",

You have seen number of companies exit, Teva of course being the largest from a portfolio standpoint, Sandoz exiting the business, Mylan exiting portfolio and there have been other disruptions as well. These actions sends the right message to our customers that the manufacturers have really gotten to a point where you have to be reasonable to be able to have viable quality manufacturers. So what we are hearing from majority of our peers as they make statements, majority of them are also looking at the market the way we do that pricing pressure is back to the single digit level and we hope that stays for the year to come and going forward. So that stabilization from a pricing standpoint and then some exits from the marketplace that we were able to leverage to be able to grow our share in a number of our older products and believe that this is the turning point for our US generic business. Now that we have material new product launches like Ranexa, like Levothyroxine hopefully ProAir later this year, we have new growth drivers for our business along with stabilizing base business.",

So typically we see that the first half will always be stronger than the second half. So we expected this sequentially, and one should see the year-on-year growth. Again the next quarter will be no different. So typically we would see more growth in the first half than in the second half. 12-14% YoY growth is what we always talk about, about few percentage points more than the market and that will continue. So we will see that into Q4 as well and certainly we see that for the forthcoming years. On the in-licensing, that is something that Lupin excels that, we have really done this well and there is no reason to not believe that it will continue more and more. Certainly, we have a pipeline of further products that we are chasing or have lined up as well and these will keep coming.",

So really we are round the corner from realizing returns from these investments with our first biosimilar, first inhalation product coming to market. As we look at the next 4-5 years, the products that we have invested in, in the last few years, in particular the complex generics, are a big part of our growth. So, we expect them to be a big part of our growth driver. So, parts of R&D that we have questioned from the efficiency standpoint in the past in particular NCE, with the MALT1 deal with AbbVie, we have started to get the return on that investment.",

It is the market that does not require lot of R&D spend. I think a meaningful generic business requires significant R&D spend, because the business is all based on new products.

We are very pleased to announce that we have entered into this transaction to divest our Kyowa business to Unison. Most of you know, that we have had a tremendous run in Japan. We invested into Japan at a time when Japanese government had just instituted incentives to increase generic utilization. Since then, we have come a long way over the last 12 years. We have grown the business multi- fold and emerged as the fifth largest generic company in Japan. However, as we look at the state of the industry today, the market has undergone significant changes. We have certainly been able to absorb the pressures that we have experienced over the last couple of years. The government has reached its stated goal of 80% generic utilization and as a result, we have seen a lot of headwinds from a pricing erosion and margin standpoint over the last couple of years. As we looked at options for Japan, we believed, to be able to really grow the business on a sustainable basis, we have to invest into new growth drivers, in particular on the specialty front - a differentiated model. As a company, we decided, given the priorities we have, in particular major markets like US as well as India, our strategy, our commitment to evolve our business into complex generics and specialty, we decided to focus our efforts into our core markets, into our major platforms and therefore determined that if we get a right partner, we get the right transaction, we were open to divesting the business. We are not used to divesting businesses as you know, but in the current situation and given our strategic priorities, we felt it was the best thing for the organization. We were very pleased to find a partner in Unison that really valued our business, valued the platform that we had built, valued our people. They are taking on all of our workforce in Japan and have a commitment to invest into the business into areas like devices, really building the company into a broader CNS cum healthcare provider in the market as opposed to just a prescription drug player. We believe it is a very good outcome for both the company, our entity in Japan as well as our people. In terms of financial perspective, it puts us in a very good position and strengthens our balance sheet significantly. We receive US $300 million of net cash and have the option in the near term to pay down our debt, as well as have growth capital to drive both our organic as well as inorganic initiatives, that we are pursuing aggressively both in US as well as India. We are very pleased with the transaction again and we will be happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you. Lupin Limited November 12, 2019",

The Women’s Health business in the US is a major focus for us. Then, in India, we have a very solid position, growing double digit on a consistent basis, but we are opportunistically looking at investments that would complement our position especially therapeutic areas that complement ours. We have strong positions in many, but also aspire to build our position in other therapeutic areas. So, selectively we are looking at those and we are looking at closer adjacencies. Geographically, as you look at our other markets, our focus in other markets whether it be South Africa, Latin America, Australia, Canada and the rest, has been to really get all our entities to self-sustenance, primarily organically. The goal in all of the other subsidiaries has been to really get them to the company’s average EBITDA margin and have the ability to invest through the entities.",

As you know, now we are talking of a regime where there are annual price cuts; we are talking about a government that is happy with the level of generic utilization and taking away incentives from further genericization. So, increasingly the Japanese market is getting more competitive. Versus that, obviously there are challenges in markets like India as well, but the bigger macroeconomic growth factors ensure much better visibility on long-term growth. The same is for the US. The US is the biggest pharmaceutical market. It is certainly the biggest generic market as well. Obviously, there is a clear intent to build out the specialty. At one level, diversification equals defraying risk a little bit; at another level, if you look at the outlook, the outlook is very positive for the US including even for regular oral solids. I think we see growth even in oral solids in the next 5 years, and it is certainly positive for India as well.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Sharma. Good afternoon, friends. Welcome to the Q3’ FY20 earnings call. Like Dr. Sharma spoke of, I would first want to address the 2 exceptional items that you see presented in the results and in the PR. I would explain each of these and then go to the normalized operational results for better clarity. Firstly, we had the Kyowa divestiture that was announced in November and finally, completion of the transaction took place on December 17. We see in the books, a one-time pretax accounting gain of Rs, 1,291 crores. Against this there were taxes, and the net amount of gain that you see is Rs. 997 crores for the quarter, which is a one-off item. The second exceptional item that you see in the numbers is the impairment of the Gavis intangibles. Certain IPs of the Gavis portfolio were reevaluated looking at the U.S. market conditions, and we have decided to take a provision for impairment. The amount is Rs.1,579 crore, roughly about US$ 228 million on the pretax line. Linked to this, there were certain deferred tax assets, which we also decided to reverse in relation to the Gavis transaction. So total impairment was US$ 288 million. The tax line contains a charge of about Rs. 405 crore and the total impairment, therefore, we have taken is about Rs.1,958 crores on account of the Gavis transaction. Im sure you would have questions on the tax line, which clearly shows that theres almost Rs. 700 crores one-off thats lying in the reported numbers. Lupin Limited February 06, 2020 Dr. Sharma has talked about the benefits of it. I would just like to say that with the Kyowa proceeds, we would be acting on deleveraging our balance sheet. The Gavis impairment improves our PBT. It positively impacts our tax rate, ETR. Also, the lightening of balance sheet on account of both these events improves the ROCE by close to 300 basis points. Moving on to the operational highlights. The results that you see for Q3 have been restated for Kyowa. All the results that you see are as per the Ind AS standards on a comparable basis, except where in the PR, we may have specified thats not the case. Sales for the quarter came in at Rs. 3,716 crores. This was 1.1% up versus the previous quarter and on a YTD basis, you see a y-o- y growth of 8%. Gross margins came in at 63.4%. Like we discussed before, its flat and also shown an improvement vis-à-vis the previous year by about 0.7%. EBITDA margin came in at 14.1% versus the previous quarter EBITDA margin of around 17.1%. This was impacted by lumpiness in expenses on account of sales promotion, a slight uptick in R&D investments as well as some of the remediation activities that are ongoing. The YTD EBITDA number has come in at 18.5%. We expect the Q4 number to be higher than the Q3 number. So eventually, for the FY 20, we should be at the lower range of the 18%-20%, expectation that we set during the course of this year. Those were the key highlights, and I would now like to open the floor for questions.",

If we remove that other income portion, then the margin scenario looks really suppressed 11.4% or something like that. So that is relatively low. Even if there would be some improvement, what you are mentioning because there would be a correction in the other expenditure line. So it will not be kind of a level, means it would still be a kind of a much lower level, what we have been seeing, that is one. And secondly, on the R&D expenditure side, so currently after the disposal of this Japanese business, the percentage of sales-wise, if you consider the ROCE spend seems really elevated. So that means the margin outlook is likely to remain very suppressed going ahead in the near future. Is that the kind of outlook that we are talking about, sir?",

We are still in the ramp-up mode and I think we have taken half of what we have targeted so far and continuing to work towards building up share in the product.

And there are certainly some direct measures that we have taken, for example, earlier, we scaled down the size of the sales force in Japan. We scaled down the size of the R&D and sales force team in the U.S. We scaled down R&D in India as well. And that was obviously something thats already gotten into the numbers.

A couple of pipeline products that we were pursuing that didnt make sense any longer. They were part of the valuation. So certainly, felt it was prudent to take the impairment on those. In terms of growth drivers, in Gavis and Somerset going forward, we have ramped up the base business, the GI products there. We are building on the controlled substances products that we have recently launched, the KCl products that we have recently launched. In the next couple of years, we see a couple of First-to-File products like Suprep goes off patent in the next couple of years, where we are First-to-File; Nascobal, where we are First-to-File. We expect to get into the market in the next couple of years. Then theres a whole pipeline effort on pretty interesting complex generics out of the site.

Why is it the highest? Its because we have multiple bets on inhalation, we have complex injectables and we have a few select biosimilars going on as well. We feel very good about our portfolio. We feel very good about the R&D that we are doing. Obviously, we are very cognizant of the Solosec Lupin Limited February 06, 2020 burn and - we are very attuned. Part of the things that Vinita talked about even in the last 3 months was a new leadership team, a new head that we brought in for the specialty business, people like Alan that we brought in on the corporate development side are also extremely strong on the specialty side. And obviously, our focus is on building that part of the business. Theres more than commensurate burn happening on the specialty side. - Generics is at a low as far as the profitability is concerned because of the R&D spend that goes into that business as well, obviously, by itself. And if you were not to spend the R&D, theres a very high level of profitability. So - that is a function of the R&D spend that we are doing. These I would call out as the big elements. As we look and as we go forward, we obviously expect growth in generics. So not just in the complex generics, but in oral solids as well, we expect growth in the next 1 year, 2 years. We see the inhalation portfolio starting from next year, not just in the U.S., but products like Fostair in Europe as well. We see injectables, weve launched the first of our injectable in December, obviously, its small, but again, the intent would be to build it forward. And weve still not delivered from areas like Nanomi, we are very happy with some of the progress weve made, but we still need to make filings, get approvals. So, theres a lot of stuff that we are investing in right now, which we are not getting return on. But we could optimize that to make sure that if we were to bring that R&D percentage down by 3% or 4%, that will go to the EBITDA line. But well be cutting our long-term future short. We see inhalation as a major growth driver in the future. We see biosimilars, even though we are only taking select opportunities, but we see biosimilars as a very solid growth driver as well. And on the third level, the injectables. We feel good about specialty, right, but we are also cognizant of the fact of the burn. We’re obviously looking at what is the best way to optimize that as well. So thats the reason why we always said that well stay at this 18%, 20%. The idea would be to basically improve by 1 or 2 percentage points each year, especially as the business takes off again, specifically U.S. generics and the specialty.",

We believe that the agency is very keen on getting products to the finish line. But we have to still traverse that path. We have to get product approvals to start monetizing it. Obviously, we are working very closely with the agency to make that happen. You mentioned facility, of course, is make or break. We are very cognizant of that as well. But as we look at some of these areas right now in the near term, you look at inhalation, which is important part of our growth driver in the next couple of years. And specifically look at the product filings, whether its albuterol in the U.S., Fostair in Europe, Spiriva in the U.S. and the facilities they are from like Pithampur Unit 3, which has gone through FDA inspection, gone through European inspections, and we feel good about the ability to get approved for these products and supply out of there. Likewise, on the biosimilars front, which, again, is a material growth driver in the next couple of years, we have received approval in Japan, we have received approval in Australia. Expect that we should be able to get product approval also in Europe and then U.S., of course, for pegfilgrastim and other products in the future. Over the last couple of years, there have been a lot of learnings along the way. As we get closer to this point, we feel good about our ability to be able to monetize this investment and this pipeline over the next few years.",

Its really based on no material product addition so far. I mean, wed hoped to get a good part of Levo into the year, wed hoped to get albuterol in the year. But Levo is ramping up only now, albuterol is delayed. Solosec has taken a little bit longer. Obviously, if you look at the year, at least from one of the major growth driver, the U.S. and the major products from the U.S., weve had a few delays and are starting to see the benefits of these in the current quarter and the quarters to come. So that is on the one side. The second area is cost optimization efforts, which weve been working pretty hard over the last 1.5 years. Well have some impact again in this quarter, but its really a more material impact in the next fiscal year. Its a combination of really executing on our pipeline on the generic front and getting operating leverage on the specialty front as well as driving cost optimization.",

One of the things that we identified in the last 2 years was to build out a lot more of our own portfolio as well. You want to get the best of both worlds. You want to be able to do the in-license products, but you also want to be able to maximize the offering of products that you could do yourself. Weve not done a good job of that in the past, but weve started working on that now. Obviously, as patent expiries hit and different other products are an opportunity to launch, we try to maximize our chances on that as well. We would do that as much as possible. We found that innovator companies are actually quite reasonable when it comes to that as long as we are doing adequate justice to their portfolio. But in-license will remain an important part of our business, but a lot of it was through the diabetes and cardiovascular products that we launched over the last 3 years. Going forward, we see in- license as important, but we dont see that many big products in these categories. We would see oncology products, we would see specific products, but we wouldnt see that much of these big in-license products. Those we would expect to make up from our own pipeline.",

Although at the EBITDA level, we are down by about 1.9%. This has also been a year of settling a lot of overhangs, which had been there in our system.

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Sharma. And friends, it’s good to be back, interacting with you all after a hiatus of 18 months. So very happy to be back with the Lupin family. In terms of the financials, results are already with you, but let me take you through this again. Sales at Rs.3,791 crores for Q4as compared to Rs.3,716 crores for the previous quarter, which actually represents a 2% growth. It’s flat as compared to Q4 of 2019. US, our most important market, grew 14% sequentially, US $212 million as compared to US$186 million in the previous quarter. Though, there has been a decline vis-à-vis Q4 of last year, and that you would recognize is essentially because of gRanexa. In terms of the full year, US sales were close to US$800 million vis-à-vis us$777 million in FY19, a growth of about 3%.India region saw a growth of 15% vis-à-vis Q4 of last year., You would also recognize that Q4 is always the weakest quarter in the year and that’s why you see a decline sequentially. India region grew about 12.7%, on a full year basis EMEA, did very well. It grew 25.3% sequentially and 7% yoy. Growth was particularly strong in South Africa. Gross margins for this quarter was 62.9% vis-à-vis 63.4%.in the previous quarter Friends, you would recognize that this is essentially a sales mix issue. In terms of the comparison with the previous year, it’s down from 68.9%, essentially because last year we had a large component coming in from Ranolazine sales in the base itself. Lupin Limited May 29, 2020 During this quarter there was favorable US dollar gains vis-à-vis the rupee, but unfortunately, it’s been negated by Forex in South Africa and Brazil. In terms of EBITDA margins, we delivered improvement in operational profitability on a sequential basis, which is 19.4%, which is 530 basis points increase vis-à-vis the previous quarter. We closed the full year at an EBIDTA margin of 18.7%, which is within the expected range of 18% to 20%. Sequentially it is higher because of lower R&D and sales promotion spends and also due to forex gains. In terms of ETR, we’ve done fairly well. Though for the full year, it’s still hovering around the 40% mark, but going forward we expect it to certainly go down. This is evident even in this particular quarter. For the full year next year, it should be around the mid 30’s mark. This year we did a lot of things in terms of the balance sheet restructuring. We undertook significant measures, in terms of optimizing our capital allocation and worked towards normalizing our ETR, which for various reasons has been higher than the standard. We divested our Japanese operations and undertook an impairment of the Gavis acquisition to strengthen our balance sheet. We believe that all of this would certainly result in better ratios over time. We used the divestiture of Kyowa to repay a large portion of the debt. The debt-equity ratio is favorable standing at around 0.12. We’re very well-positioned for better performance in the quarters to come. But for sure there is this overhang of COVID at least in the first quarter.",

We saw really the OB/GYN clinic visits come down to 20% level pre-COVID, and only for critical conditions. From Q3, we had started to see a good ramp up into Q4 in January, and in February we started to see the COVID impact, which impacted the scrips which we have seen Lupin Limited May 29, 2020 down to almost 45% pre-COVID levels at the lowest. In the last 4 weeks we have started to see this stabilize. In April, we saw the scrip levels hit the bottom and since then weve seen it grow slowly. However, we have taken some significant measures to optimize that business. We had realized that Solosec is going to be a slower build, it had consistent growth but still at a slower level. Pre-COVID we just saw a strong reception to virtual calls, and doctor coverages through telehealth and taking virtual calls as opposed to the face-to-face interaction. We have really restructured our operating model going forward, to a higher level of virtual investment, and very significantly reduced our operating spend and burn rate nearly by 50%. We downsized the field team in the last couple of weeks to be able to really reduce that burn. So now having restructured the team, plus having the same focus on a different mix of virtual versus face-to-face interaction, starting to see scrip ramp up from the low of April. The recent wins that we had through the Solosec was put on preferred position by ESI couple of weeks ago. We also had very positive readout of trichomoniasis study to expand the use of Solosec. We feel pretty good about growing the business at a burn rate that we can sustain while Solosec grows.",

The kind of products that we bring to the market, the kind of cost that you incur and of course the R&D expense and the like. I dont want to talk more about these products which anyway would happen over time. And we are, as you would know, geared up for a lot of things. We have our inhalations portfolio, we have biosimilars, we have specialty and complex injectables and the like, but all of those will happen over time. But one thing thats constant out there is, trying to read out the boundaries when it comes to, on the cost front. This is going to be across several lines. Weve had a continuous engagement program with leading consultants working on several lines. We have a program to implement on the procurement front, which is really the raw materials, alternate vendors and the route synthesis and conversion. We are working on SG&A, the R&D expense front and for sure on the overall workforce itself. So we have actually seen some good results through the course of this year. Its not so visible to you because its actually camouflaged in several parts. And there are several moving parts there itself, amongst lines. But as we unfold and as we go into the future, I would imagine there would be significant visibility on that, towards the end of the next fiscal, that is you would actually see a closing date which is certainly Lupin Limited May 29, 2020 superior. But all of this, assuming that normalcy returns in terms of the business. As you would know, the first quarter would be impacted because of COVID across various parts of the globe. India, for sure, there are dark clouds. There are dark clouds in America. There is Forex fluctuation in the emerging markets. And business is down in other parts also. So those are again, something that we cant actually talk about, but in a general sense, you would expect that there is going to be tremendous focus on cost, and that would be contained.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Sharma. Dear friends, welcome to our Q1FY21 results webinar. This is the first time we are conducting the results discussion through the digital platform and I believe that if we find this suitable, we will continue this format in the subsequent quarters as well. Let me take you through the key aspects of our Q1 performance. We had already guided for a tough quarter, because we had felt the tremors of the same, due to the impact of COVID-19 in May itself. We felt that the impact of market disruption could be across all the regions including two of our largest markets, India, and the US. However, our API business outperformed this quarter. At Rs.3,468 crores, overall revenues were lower than the previous quarter by 8.5% and lower than previous year by 9.1%. The US business performed steadily at US$ 180 - 190 million over the whole of last year. We saw this reaching US$ 212 million in the last quarter i.e. Q4FY20. However, the US sales declined by 26% sequentially and 28% YoY to US$ 157 million. This was because of demand contraction by 12% versus the previous quarter and over 6% vis-à-vis the previous year. The seasonality factor also played in and therefore we saw loss of sales in the Oseltamivir, Azithromycin & Cephalosporins business and there is impact of Metformin as well. In India, where we have consistently performed over several quarters, there was COVID impact and India region branded formulations declined 6% YoY, especially the acute products. As per IQVIA, Lupin’s growth in Q1 was -1.4%, whilst for the IPM it was -4.9%. In June, there was some demand revival but there was disruption again in July. But we do expect Q2 to be much better than Q1 as demand picks up again from August. As said before, API sales showed significant growth of 24.5% sequentially with strong positive momentum on demand Lupin Limited Aug 7, 2020 as well as pricing. We expect the strong double-digit growth YoY to continue. On the gross margin front, we did well to actually sustain it at 62.9%, and this despite the fact there was sharp decline in US business as I had stated before, and also the impact of higher freight cost. But all the same, we were able to maintain the margins underlined improvements in overall business. Manpower cost increase in this quarter is on account of one time spent in terms of specialty restructuring in the US and COVID linked incentives. However, we do believe from Q2 onwards, we would expect the recurring benefits due to the specialty restructuring and we expect the overall absolute number to be lower than Q4FY20. Overall, on the manufacturing & other expenses, including the freight (the freight element was captured in terms of gross margins itself), expenses were higher by close to Rs.100 crores. However, there was significant fall in manufacturing & other expenses in terms of travel, legal & consulting fees, sales promotion expenses and the like. As you would recognize it was not possible to call on doctors, so there was considerable saving on that, promotions did not take place and so on. It is not necessarily something wholly sustainable but having said that it would be our endeavor to take digital means and try to sustain it at levels which are lower than the past. As we normalize the operations, we do expect some increase in the SG&A expenses but the savings to some extent will certainly continue. On the EBIDTA front we are happy to report an operating EBIDTA improvement of 1% over the last quarter but recognize this is without including FOREX and other income. We are confident that this EBIDTA trajectory will continue to improve in Q2 and beyond. I had guided for close to 19-20% which included other income and Fx impact as well, but had also added a caveat that this is before taking into account the situation on account of COVID. We re-evaluated the entire thing and we do believe that we should be to able to close at about 17% without any impact of FOREX or other income. In terms of the outlook we expect operating margin to improve, as we expect market share expansion of Levothyroxine and relaunch of Glumetza before the end of Q2. Additionally, customers start their winter buying and this should help products like Azithromycin, Cephalosporins and, Oseltamivir. Further, we look forward to the much-awaited launch of Albuterol in September-20. In addition, we have also partnered for a few products that we will be launching in next couple of months. Aided by tight control on manpower costs, SG&A expenses and rationalization of costs on the specialty front, we believe that we will be in position to boost the margins. In terms of the ETR which has been a sore point, it remains high this quarter, but we expect this to improve in H2FY21 with ramp up in sales and the specialty restructuring. For the full year we believe that ETR would be between 35% - 40%. With this we would like to open the floor for discussions. Lupin Limited Aug 7, 2020",

There are multiple milestones that we will hit on inhalation. There are other assets that are under development, filings as well. So, its a critical year from the inhalation perspective. On biosimilars at this point of time, it is Etanercept from a launch perspective, which we intend to launch this quarter in Europe. By the end of the year, we expect to file our Pegfilgrastim as well. Again, multiple milestones in biosimilars that will be there. And then switching to the compliance, weve had a very solid first half. The inspections that we had in the first quarter, were all positive in terms of outcome and we had slated this ought to be the year of completely earning back our rightful space on the compliance front. Obviously, with COVID, and with the restrictions with the FDA not really being in a position to do audits, theres a bit of a limbo at this point on our OAI facilities. But I think the momentum is to continue and we are aligned with FDA in that, everybody wants supply continuity, everybody wants facilities that are compliant to be up and running. Were working with the FDA; weve made a lot of progress at sites. Somerset, we have already put up for re-inspection, Goa & Pithampur, both of these are possibly in the next month going to be ready for re-inspection. And were going to really work with FDA to see what the best way would be. I dont think theres a stated remote virtual audit process. There is certainly a document review process, there is a mutual recognition process as well. Well have to push the envelope and see what the best way will be to do it. But, again, from our own internal development, theres a lot of strength, which has been built on the compliance front. And we certainly expect to take this to the finish line.",

We get a very small percentage of the government business supplying out of India. in any case, because there is a preference for local manufacturing. This order, depending on how its executed could mandate or give significant preference to local manufacturing on the government front which, from our perspective we see as an incremental opportunity. Based on the conversations that we are having with the government, they are very cognizant of the role that India plays in the US supply chain. They are highly focused on drug pricing as we have seen in the other orders. We, as an industry, have made them aware of the impact of manufacturing in the US versus India the cost impact. They understand this incremental cost impact. So, we do expect that this move towards manufacturing is going to be around areas of high national importance, which right now is COVID related products, anti-infectives and a couple of categories that the government has highlighted broadly. Well find out, over the next couple of weeks and months, how this transpires into actual products but our expectation is again, its going to be essential medicines, more COVID related in the near term, which will be an upside for us. Also, the government business opportunity will be an upside for us.",

We are now selectively reexamining, if you go deeper into our compliance issues, one of the big areas was investigations. I think weve been able to now start inspiring confidence in our actions on the investigations front and that gives us the opportunity on what is the best way to structure this, so that we take more of an internal lead rather than a third party lead for some sites. Other sites where we feel that we still need to have input, we continue to do that. Were relooking at the scope of third-party work. Were examining that very closely at this point of time.

From a portfolio evolution standpoint, we have significant opportunities starting with the rollout of a complex generic assets this year - Albuterol and Fostair on the inhalation front, plus, Enbrel on the biosimilars front, on the specialty front with NaMuscla which is ramping up very nicely as well in Europe. We are looking at the potential of getting it into the US market and building on Solosec on the specialty front in the US. As we look at the next couple of years, we have a whole Lupin Limited Aug 7, 2020 pipeline of these complex generic assets and these platforms playing out after Albuterol and Fostair this year. We expect in the next year we’ll have other inhalation products - Brovana that we are approved for, Perforomist that we expect to get approved for, Dulera that we have filed, and then Spiriva in the following year. So, the inhalation portfolio will play a material part in the next couple of years. On the biosimilars front with Enbrel starting this year, and full year impact next year, plus pegfilgrastim coming into the market in FY23, and you start seeing impact of biosimilars in the US and Europe over the next two years. And then the injectable portfolio coming thereafter. We really see all of the investments that we have made in the complex generic front, we are right at the inflection point to benefit from it in the next couple of years driving top line growth, hopefully on an annualized basis. But in a 5-year timeframe, double digit growth.",

We certainly will have that benefit FY22 onwards. Plus, all initiatives around manpower and cost containment, which you will see Q2 onwards, like Ramesh said. Our manpower costs will be below the Q4FY20 level. We are very determined to keep it under control and make sure that we are getting the right productivity, from a manpower standpoint. Likewise, on the SG&A front, we see some potential for improvement. We have seen some savings just as a result of COVID and COVID related cost. Travel and promotional costs will see some ramp up, but we certainly see a real opportunity to bank savings on that front as well. As we look at the impact of our portfolio and building up our revenues, with the complex assets, biosimilars, specialty, plus the strong control on the cost lines, in particular manpower and SG&A, and maintaining R&D at under 10% of net sales, we expect to Lupin Limited Aug 7, 2020 get our EBITDA margin to the right level in the 20s.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr Sharma. Friends, welcome to a good set of numbers as compared to our recent past. This quarter, we saw a rebound in several ways. Sales for Q2, were Rs.3,781 crores compared to Rs.3,468 crores in Q1, a growth of 9% QoQ, and 1% decline over the same period last year. However, you should also remember that last year, we had an NCE licensing income. If you were to knock that off, sales were actually up by 2.9% YoY. US sales grew by 15% sequentially to US$ 180 mn vis-a-vis USD 157 mn in Q1. The reasons for the growth were essentially launch of Albuterol coupled with inline generics going up in Q2. The India Region saw a 0.7% YoY decline due to COVID impact on demand, especially for acute products. We are seeing growth in the market now and expect Q3 to be much better than Q2. Degrowth in the acute products sharply reduced in Q2 as compared to Q1. We continue to outperform the market in focussed chronic therapy areas, as in the case of anti-diabetic and cardiac In H2, we expect to grow by 6% to 8% overall. API sales continues to show strong growth of 22.5% YoY due to improved pricing as well as favourable forex as compared to Q2 of last year. API sales were down 8.6% QoQ due to low volumes on some of our key products. We have seen price stabilized at Q1 levels. Sales for EMEA grew by 30.4% QoQ due to pick-up in demand in all markets as well as the launch of Etanercept in Germany through our partner, Mylan. Sales of Growth Markets grew by 8.1% QoQ due to pick-up in demand in most markets led by Mexico and Philippines. Coming up to the gross margins, gross margins were up at 63.5% as compared to 62.9% in the previous quarter. This is coming from an overall business mix improvement led by America, slight moderation on the freight rates and of course the fruits of continuous improvement programs that we have been pursuing for the last several quarters. There is no significant impact of forex in Q2 vis-a-vis Q1. One November 5, 2020 very important development during this quarter was on the employee benefit line. In Q2, we closed at Rs.685 crores, vis-a-vis Rs.793 crores in Q1, a reduction of well over Rs.100 crores. This is led by the specialty restructuring we did in the last quarter plus there were some COVID linked incentives. We took a lot of steps to contain the overall costs and the benefits are there for you to see in Q2. We expect this to continue, though we do believe that Q3 would be slightly higher led by increments, which would be declared. Manufacturing and other expenses in Q2 was Rs.1186 crores as compared to Rs.958 crores, essentially driven by forex losses, higher R&D spends and. sales promotion expenses. There are also certain one-time costs contained in here. We believe that our focus on SG&A expenses will continue, and you will see this bearing fruit and operating leverage really clicking in Q3 and Q4. In terms of ETR, we have taken a number of steps, as could be seen in the results itself, there has been tremendous improvement. The full year ETR we believe would be in the mid-30s. If you look at the EBITDA margins, which is the most important thing, we believe that we have delivered tremendously on our promises. The reasons for that are covered in the gross margin’s explanation, as well as the improvement that we saw on the manpower line We believe - that we would deliver on the promises we made. If you’d recall, we guided for 19% to 20% in the beginning of this year. But I also said that because of COVID things are a little fluid. We now strongly believe that going forward there would be a tremendous improvement in EBITDA and perhaps you will see Q4 at around 18.5% and overtime we will be back to the 20% - 22% level that we were always known for in the past. With this, we open the floor for Q&A session.",

Likewise, in Glumetza generic relaunch, were very pleased to relaunch in September as we promised and have been able to gain share. There was a disruption in the marketplace at the time that we relaunched, much like when we had to recall the product and we are again ramping up share there.",

So obviously, America would perform much better with Tamiflu and a host of other products as well, Cepholosporins and the like. We expect normalization on the freight front as well. Theres continuous improvement on the various initiatives on the gross margins. We think that gross margins would tend to be a little higher than what it is today. When you come to the manpower cost, whilst I said that there will be a slight increase in Q3, and that will sustain in Q4, its just that, its coming out of increments. we dont expect a radical shift. It will be Rs.10 crores odd to speak it will not be huge. And theres a tremendous focus on cost, especially when it comes to sales and promotion expenses and the like. So, all of this will certainly bear fruit and we think that we should be a programmed for something about 18.5% as a run rate going forward for Q4.",

We have other new product launches in this quarter as well as next quarter. We have Tacrolimus, Mycophenolate, Posaconazole, Dimethyl Fumarate, that were planning to launch shortly in the next couple of weeks.

We have made progress across each of these areas in the last couple of months and quarters. We expect to launch first, one of our peptide products, Ganirelix, in particular, that we are getting ready to file this fiscal year. We would hope that it is launched in the next fiscal year. And then our iron products will follow that and then both the Nanomi Depot products paliperidone and Risperidone as well as the liposomal products doxorubicin and Ambisome will be in. So, thats roughly the evolution from a launch perspective. On the injectable side, there is good synergy with biosimilars. We have the Pegfilgrastim product that is progressing very well in development. We hope to file that later this fiscal year and the commercial strength that we have started to build on the institutional front is something that we leverage across both biosimilars as well as injectables.

Weve seen some people do a much more virtual kind of interactio, some people happy with just more of a document kind of review. As you know, the USFDA does not have an approach aligned for remote kind of inspection. There have been document requests, weve had a couple as well, a lot of other companies have had as well. I think those go more in the line of PAIs, for facilities that are otherwise already compliant or even for new facilities, for that matter. So, its a little bit all over the place. Some of the regulatory bodies are just choosing to extend GMP certifications, some of the others are choosing remote interactions as well. We personally felt that the remote interaction was extremely effective. Like Vinita said we will we love to see how we can engage with USFDA, to move some of our OAI or warning letter facilities ahead.",

But Australia, Mexico and Brazil, all normalizing very fast. Europe performed particularly very well in Q2. We expect that momentum to be sustained across Europe as well as South Africa.

For the last couple of quarters, it’s fairly stable in the mid-single digit kind of erosion, if you compare it to last year. As far as Solosec goes, the last two quarters have been quite a dynamic situation on that business. One, because of COVID itself the business was down 50% and then with the restructuring, bringing the sales force down from 120 plus people to 45 people in June, certainly had an impact on our share of voice. So, if you look at it, Q2 versus Q1, our scrips are relatively flat, and revenues also relatively flat. Obviously, thats not what we are satisfied with. The team is working on ramping up the scrips and revenues. There is a strong focus around the managed-care wins that we have had, more targeted pull through efforts around the territories and November 5, 2020 physicians with the managed care wins. And second, we are also working to increase our share of voice mean. Given the drop in the Salesforce, as well as share of our voice, and the product being very promotion sensitive, we are working on non-face- to-face, a digital complement to our face-to-face interaction to increase our share of voice. And third, one of the near-term major opportunities that we have is the trichomoniasis indication that we filed for this past quarter in August. We would expect that indication to be approved by June or so next year and that is another opportunity for us to reposition Solosec. We are hoping that the COVID impact is going to be minimized by then, because COVID is still impacting the calls in the OBGYN offices. Our calls are right now ~35% face to face. 65% are still virtual calls. So, were hoping that also will improve. As we get into, Q4’FY21, , i.e. going into the first quarter of next calendar year, we hope to be optimized from a share of voice standpoint, as well as a targeting standpoint to be able to leverage that BV as well as trich into June next year.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Sharma. Dear friends, welcome to Q3 FY21 earnings call. Happy to share with you a good set of numbers after quite some time. Let me walk you through the key aspects of our Q3 performance. Q3 has been a good quarter for us with sequential sales growth across all markets - highlighted by 3% QoQ growth in the India formulations business and 4% QoQ growth in the U.S. business with continuous ramp up of Albuterol. Despite the impact of weak flu season seen across various parts of the globe, weve been able to post sales growth both sequentially vis-a-vis Q2 FY21 as well as YoY vis-a-vis Q3 FY20. The operating EBITDA has also improved sequentially for the fourth quarter in a row, due to improvement in business mix and reflection of some of the cost optimization efforts on the profitability front. Talking about sales - U.S. sales grew by 4% sequentially at US$188 million in Q3 FY21, as compared to US$180 million in Q2 FY21, and grew by 1% as compared to Q3 FY20. The sequential growth was driven by ramp up in Albuterol as well as new products like Lapatinib, Tacrolimus etc. The demand for seasonal products continues to be pretty weak on back of the weakest flu season in the last decade, leading to a fall in quite a few of those products as compared to the previous year. Other in-line products however. remain stable. India region saw a growth of 5.4% YoY, since demand for acute as well as chronic products picked up as the market began to open up, leading to higher patient visits to the clinics. Despite the low contributions from COVID therapy January 29, 2021 products, we have been able to match IPM growth this quarter led by superior performance of our chronic portfolio. API sales de-grew QoQ with low volumes for some of our antibiotic APIs on account of a weaker flu season in most parts of the world. Gross margins were up by 1.4% vis-a-vis the previous quarter at 64.9%, driven by improvement in the business mix across regions and continued moderation of freight rates. We did some excellent work on the manpower cost front. Employee benefits expenses in Q3 came in at INR7,070 million as compared to INR6,850 million in Q2 on account of increments rolled out during the quarter and certain one-time restructuring costs. However, we recognize, this is quite lower as compared to the previous years. Employee benefits have come down to less than 18%, as a percentage of sales from 20% seen in FY20. We will continue efforts to improve from the current levels. On the manufacturing & other expenses front, theres a reduction, driven by lower forex losses and R&D offset by higher SG&A spend and higher royalty on partnered products. Most important line from our perspective is the EBITDA. Operating EBITDA is 18.6% excluding forex and other income. However, the top line EBITDA is 20.4%, as you would recognize. On the other operating income line, we saw the full impact of loss of MEIS export benefits for this quarter and barring the one-off income linked to litigation settlement recognized in Q3, this would have been about INR250 to 300 million on a normalized basis. To repeat again, Q3 operating EBITDA adjusted for the one-off is about 18.6%, excluding forex and other income, and this compares well with 16.8% in Q2, an increase of 1.8% as you would recognize. The ETR came down to 15.9% with all our key subsidiaries reporting profits in Q3 along with the various initiatives taken to rationalize ETR. For the full year, expect the ETR to be in the mid-30s. With this, I open the floor for discussions.",

On the depot products out of Netherlands, the first two products are ready to go into the clinic. Actually, the first product is going into the clinic this quarter. The second will go into the clinic in the next couple of months. We have the liposomal products out of ForDoz, where were making really good progress as well. We would expect at least one filing in the next fiscal year. If possible, well try to get both the filings in the next fiscal year. On the peptides, we are making progress as well, getting ready to file a couple of products in the next few months and likewise on the iron colloid products as well. So, we have come a pretty long way on the complex injectables. On the biosimilars front apart from Etanercept, we made really good progress on Pegfilgrastim. Look forward to filing that in the U.S. this quarter and are getting ready to put together our go-to-market plans, build commercial capabilities and be ready to launch it in the next fiscal year or early the following fiscal year.",

We would expect in the next 12 to 24 months for the product to be rolled out in all the key markets. So, its a slow buildup of share. On Pegfilgrastim, we certainly believe that it continues to be an attractive opportunity based on the go-to-market plans that our team has built and the segments that we are targeting. We believe that it should continue to be a reasonable opportunity, especially given the dynamics in the biosimilars market, where you dont see the kind of price erosion. Of course, well have to earn our share, which our team is working on the strategies to make sure that we do. But Im looking forward to that launch in CY22.",

The accelerators are -- we continue to get additional formulary access through recent efforts. We have been able to get the product in. So, that is a positive. We have the trichomoniasis indication, which is an opportunity to reposition the product. A really nice opportunity in the summer. We expect that in June. Right now, were gearing up to launch the trichomoniasis indication successfully in June. Im hoping that with the vaccine rollout, things start improving by mid of this year. Im hoping that we start seeing real traction in the second half of this calendar year. I mean so far, when I look at it quarter- on-quarter, the scripts have kind of flattened. With some of the gross to net improvements, one has seen some pricing improvement quarter after quarter. But a meaningful build, would be after the trichomoniasis indication launch and for the COVID environment to abate a bit as well.",

So, when you compare to the last year, both the flu products as well as Metformin products are really missing in our top line.

The first one is - with the Democrats coming back to power in the US, just wanted to know what is the pricing scenario the management is expecting? Do you expect any pressure on the pricing, given that you have kind of said that they will make the healthcare more affordable going forward? And second question is on the albuterol.

Especially pricing of high-priced brands, biologics, oncology drugs would likely be under pressure. But we really see it as an opportunity for affordable medicines, the part of the business that we participate in from a generic side. Obviously, all of our generics are affordable medicines as well as biosimilars i.e. affordable versions of biologics. We see it as a positive for the generic side of the industry. On albuterol, certainly Cipla had a head start from a timing perspective into the market. After we launched, we ramped up our share in couple of months to 9% plus, while still ramping up our supply. We see a really good opportunity for us, given that we are the only true generic to ProAir, which is the largest part of the market. With Perrigo going out of the market, Lupin is the only true generic to ProAir and has the ability to ramp up to be the largest product from a generic perspective. Were looking forward to the next couple of quarters, this quarter, next quarter to be able to ramp the product up. Rajakumar V: Thank you, Vinita. Thats helpful. Thank you. January 29, 2021",

Its my pleasure to welcome you all on our behalf. You already have the financial results in your hands, and you would have seen that we have had a good quarter. Sales for the quarter were flat YoY, while they were 4% lower sequentially, as India business, which is almost 34% of our business, is generally soft in Q4, while it was a very poor flu season in the US. But whats interesting and what you would have seen already, is that we have improved our EBITDA substantially by 500 basis points on YoY basis. On an annual basis, revenues are largely flat on YoY basis, down by 1.4%. As the entire year was ridden with COVID challenges across geographies, I think the team has done reasonably well to at least maintain the revenues. To me, what is very heartening to see, is that the EBITDA has definitely improved by about 220 basis points YoY for FY21, which we had promised you in the past and we do hope to keep working on this even as we go forward. With that little commentary, I would handover to Ramesh to share with you the financial details and then well open the floor for question and answers. Thank you very much and over to you, Ramesh.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr Sharma. Dear friends, welcome to our results webinar. I trust all of you are keeping well and your family members are also doing well. Its a terrible time out there. Its important that we all stay safe. Let me walk you through the key aspects of our Q4 performance. Q4 has been a challenging quarter for us, given the surge in COVID cases with the second and third wave across many geographies, and this is true for a lot of other pharma companies also. In this tough environment, the company’s Q4 sales have come down by 4% sequentially and 0.8% YoY. The US business saw 4% growth sequentially, with the continued ramp up of albuterol. This is despite the continued impact of the weak flu season. Across various parts of the globe, a weak flu season impacted our sales both sequentially as well as over the previous year. However, in spite of the headwinds on the growth of the company, we continued on the path of improved profitability. The operating EBITDA, excluding the one-time settlement income in Q3, improved sequentially for the fifth quarter in a row due to the improvement in the business mix and May 13, 2021 sustained measures on the cost front. We endeavour to drive our sales and profitability by driving the profitability mix, bringing more niche products to our portfolio and continued improvement on our cost control and optimization initiatives. Sales for Q4 were INR 3,759 crores compared to INR 3,917 crores in Q3, which is a 4% sequential decline and down by 0.8% YoY when compared to INR 3,791 crores in Q4 last year. Coming to geography-wise sales, US sales grew by 3.7% sequentially to USD 195 million in Q4 as compared to USD 188 million in Q3, and lower by 8% as compared to USD 212 million in Q4FY20. As you might recall, COVID was around the corner and there was a surge in demand in anticipation of lockdown conditions in America last year, and it was also a normal flu season last year. The sequential growth is driven by a ramp up in albuterol and other new products like posaconazole that more than offset the flu season decline QoQ. Demand for seasonal products continued to be weak on back of the weakest flu season in the last decade, leading to a USD 36 million fall in sales of oseltamivir, azithromycin and cephalosporins as compared to Q4FY20. Coming to India business, Indian branded formulations saw a growth of 6.4% YoY in Q4 as demand picked up. As per IQVIA, Lupins growth in Q4 was 5.9% vis-a-vis 8.5% for the IPM. Acute product sales have grown in Q4 versus de- growth that we had seen in Q1 and Q2 and is higher than Q3. For the full year, India branded formulations exhibited growth of 4.5% vis-a-vis the previous year. As per IQVIA, IPM growth is 4.3% compared to Lupin growth of 3.9%. API sales showed a 25.6% decline QoQ with low volumes on some of our key antibiotic APIs on account of weaker flu season in most parts of the globe. As far as EMEA and growth markets are concerned, EMEA grew by 14.6% QoQ due to strong demand in South Africa, NaMuscla and scale-up of Etanercept. Sales for growth markets is lower by 8.5% QoQ due to the second wave of COVID hitting us in several countries. On the gross margins front, Q4FY21 gross margin was 65% as compared to 64.9% in Q3FY21. This is driven by improvement in business mix in US, led by albuterol. However, on account of slowdown in seasonal products for flu season, we have had higher write-offs in this quarter. Thus, the net improvement was just 10 basis points. Over the previous year, the margin improved by 210 basis points, which is primarily on account of better mix in US and higher API margin. This is partly offset by higher freight rates and high growth in low-margin business of Brazil and Australia. Weve done a stellar job when it comes to the employee benefit expense. In Q4FY21, this is INR 640 crores as compared to INR 707 crores in the previous quarter. If you recall, it was INR 764 crores in Q4 last year. Lower expenses in Q4 is largely due to one-time savings coming in from pruning up of annualized May 13, 2021 schemes and change in policy. We, however, expect employee costs to be in the sub 18% range in spite of the increments which will kick-in in Q1. We brought it down from 22.9% in Q1FY21, which is a very good achievement. Manufacturing and other expenses in Q4 is at INR 1,118 crores as compared to INR 1,157 crore in Q3 and INR 1,152 crores in Q4FY20. The decrease of INR 34 crores YoY is driven by lower selling and promotional expenses, offset by higher royalties on partnered products. On the EBITDA front, we have reported a fifth consecutive quarter of operating EBITDA margins improvement in spite of degrowth in sales. Operating EBITDA is 18.8% excluding forex and other income for this quarter, which is 20 basis points higher than normalized EBITDA of Q3. As you recall, in Q3, whilst the top line EBITDA margins were higher, it was because of one- time settlement income. You would also appreciate that there has been continuous increase over the last five quarters, which has been a result of several initiatives that we have taken on the cost front, including procurement, routes to synthesis, renegotiating contracts, rationalization of our sales force in America and other parts and so on. We continue to strive to work on this and we will see certain improvements coming across in the future as well. We are particularly proud about our achievement on the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) front. In the course of the year, we have been working on various initiatives to optimize the overall ETR and it’s reflecting in the full year ETR numbers. Its come down from 40% last year to 26.7% for the full year in FY21. In this quarter, it is particularly low because we had over-provided in the previous quarters and weve rolled it back. It is also because of the fact that several of our subsidiaries have turned profitable, especially America; further Brazil broke even last quarter. We expect the ETR to remain at similar levels in FY22 and we will be continuously working to further optimize on this. With this short introduction, I would open the floor for discussions.",

We are hoping that this is going to be the way to engage with the FDA because, right now, its extremely unpredictable of when the FDA would be able to travel to India. We believe that this will be the way. I think its a big positive that theyve come up with this guidance and it really is applicable for everything. It is for surveillance, its for OAIs where CAPAs are complete and PAIs as well. Most other agencies have adopted this approach already and were hoping that the FDA will start reflecting it in their actions soon as well. We dont have a specific update at this point of time, but the fact that the FDA has come up with that guidance and approach is a big positive.",

We built a lot of goodwill with the customers, over time, as we ramped up the product with the ranitidine decline. We feel pretty good about holding on to significant share and maximizing as much value as we can. There obviously is going to be erosion on the famotidine front, but we expect to more than make that up and support a very strong double-digit growth with what we have planned around albuterol, the other inhalation products, gBrovana, gPerforomist and also growth in our in-line products.

It took time to establish them. It took time to establish capabilities. It took time to really get the pipeline together, but we are starting to see the results of it. As we look now, at the inhalation portfolio paying off. We will see in the next couple of years, the ramp up of the inhalation portfolio business. Then the injectables will start contributing. We now have a very solid portfolio on the injectables front, with depot injectables, peptides, iron products and liposomal products through a partnership. So, that will start contributing in the next two to three years. Biosimilars started contributing ex-US with Etanercept. In the next couple of years, we would start seeing contribution of products like Pegfilgrastim and then Ranibizumab and beyond. As we look at return over the next five years, the complex generics are our biggest growth drivers when we look at our five-year plan - revenues and also margins. Overall, your question on R&D investment, as Ramesh said at the beginning of the call, that we have managed to keep our R&D investment under control. We were over 10% two years ago. We were at the 9% level in this past year. It will continue to decline as a percentage of sales, while our R&D investment continues to increase YoY, just given our revenue potential is also pretty strong now going forward.

Vinita did give us a flavor of the fact that we are looking at a host of complex injectables, inhalation products, biosimilars, and of course, specialty itself at some point. Apart from that, we have been continuously working on cost improvement in terms of procurement policies, in terms of routes to synthesis, re-negotiating on contracts, looking at rationalization of our workforce on the sales front, on the R&D front and also the manufacturing front. All of this has been paying results. Obviously, there is more to come. Its a continuous exercise.

They cited some of the observations which have plagued us for a while, like investigations as well, and yet we received the EIRs and satisfactory closures. Weve worked a lot, especially on some of the India sites, like Pithampur Unit- 2, lesser so in Goa and Tarapur because there wasnt a deeper fix that we wanted to put in place.

In the first quarter, it was close to about 22%. As long as we are able to bring in newer products and keep an eye on cost, we should be okay, and thats exactly what we have been trying to do for the last now several quarters. We have been working on several projects, on all the cost lines, starting from gross margins viz. procurement costs as well as cost of conversion. Theres a lot of focus on that. We worked with external consultants to get that focus. When it comes to cost lines beyond that, for example, the indirect cost, SG&A expenses, contracts that we pre-negotiated with a host of our vendors, we have brought in productivity gains on R&D as well as the sales force. We have rationalized sales force in various parts, all this helped to rein in the costs. During the course of the year, we brought down the overall manpower cost, and its something that we alluded to even during the course of this call. We spoke about the fact that it came down. In this quarter, its been particularly low. All of this helps. The introduction of products across various markets, across the most important markets, would certainly help moving, nudging the EBITDA margins upward going forward. And of course, there is always going to be a continuous emphasis on cost reduction",

We have brought spend down significantly through a combination of reduced footprint of the sales force, plus virtual interaction with the physicians. At this point in time, we are focused on the next major lever, which is the trichomoniasis launch, which we hope to do in the next quarter actually. We are waiting for feedback from the agency and well time really a re-launch of the product, with lower level of spend at this point in time. Thats where we are on Solosec. With the changes that we have made, we expected some disruption. We have seen disruption. But in the last couple of months, we have started to see some growth, although minor. I think the major trigger for us is going to be trich and likely see the impact in the second half of the fiscal year. Simultaneously, we look further for opportunities. We are looking at a couple of other opportunities right now that potentially will be accretive for the womens health business and building up the pipeline. We have had really good success, the three programs in the pipeline on the womens health front with the agency. In particular, there are two programs where weve had success with the agency and progressing them into the clinic very rapidly.",

In a quarter that was impacted by pressures in the US, we are pleased to deliver 22.2% growth YoY and 12.7% growth QoQ, bolstered by US$50 million milestone received from Boehringer Ingelheim in this quarter. Business without the milestone income grew by 11.4% YoY and 2.8% QoQ. QoQ growth was driven by our India business that grew 27.2% and Growth Markets that recorded 9.7% growth. Indian market grew 39.2% including COVID therapies and 32.4% excluding these. The acute market grew 52.5% and we grew 45.4%. The chronic market grew 19.4% and we grew 22.6%. HCP attendance is back to 90% levels and patient footfall is 77%. Our call average is 9.6. We see high-teens growth in India for the year overall. US revenues were down sequentially due to competitive pressures on some of our base business products, famotidine in particular, as new competition entered. Additionally, there is an element of failure to supply due to supply chain issues that cropped up last year and that we have settled with our customers currently. Further, for our Albuterol generic, we’re transitioning from spot buying to long-term contracts. Albuterol is ramping up nicely and based on our commitments, it is on track to get to 18% - 20% market share with a major pickup in Q3. Brovana AG has been a successful launch in the quarter and we expect it to contribute to growth in the current year. We August 11, 2021 remain committed to grow our US business, both with our in-line products as well as ramp-up of Albuterol and Brovana AG, continue above market growth in India and of course ensure growth in every part of the business. We feel extremely good about our NCE efforts and we are exploring ways to better fund the path forward, including a potential spin out. Coming to margins, gross margin as a percentage is down to 63.9% due to change in reporting of partnered products in the US. Royalties on partnered products were reflected in the SG&A, manufacturing and other expense line earlier and is now reflected in the gross margins line itself. On a net basis partnered products are EBITDA accretive. Gross margin was also impacted by change in sales mix, so far as India vis-a-vis America is concerned. US margins were lower this quarter, driven by increased competition and slower ramp- up of Albuterol. Whilst the quarters profits were bolstered by Boehringer Ingelheim MEK program income, despite a tough operating environment, we see substantial room for growth. Employee cost was up vis-a-vis our Q4, primarily due to increments in India and higher sales incentives for IRF given the significantly higher sales in this quarter. Q4 last year was also significantly lower given certain incentive reversals in India. Amongst our peer set, we’re the only ones that were able to bring down the manpower cost down as an absolute number in FY 21. We intend to maintain tight control on this line, while ensuring growth for the future. Manufacturing and other expenses were down 8% QoQ. This was partly because of the reclassification of partnered products royalty into COGM, as I spoke before. Promotion expenses went up because of increased business, especially in India. R&D expenses were 9.7% of sales and we expect to hold this number tightly without losing out on opportunities. EBITDA without NCE income and forex loss stood at 14.3%, a level that we are not happy with at all, after the EBITDA improvement that we delivered through the quarters last year. We see meaningful uplift in the second half and remain focused on journey of expanding margins, by driving strong double-digit revenue growth and optimizing on cost, whilst ensuring the safety of our people and the highest standards of compliance. While we see our business in particular in the US, improve quarter after quarter based on Albuterol and Brovana AG ramp up and stabilizing base business, we have embarked on accelerating additional optimization efforts across our manufacturing and supply chain, including tackling idle cost for product categories where the demand has dropped. We are looking at finding solutions for areas like specialty, biosimilars and NCE, including spinouts. Whilst we are not happy with our performance, we remain committed to improve our business throughout this fiscal. We expect revenues to grow in the double-digits, both in India and in other parts, including America and EBITDA to be 17% to 18% in the second half, which is lower than our earlier August 11, 2021 guidance of 19% to 20%. We see meaningful bounce back in the second half, driven by increased sales in Albuterol, higher base in India and growth across various markets. With this, may I open the floor for the discussions.",

Really trying to find more creative ways to be able to bring in additional partners - financing partners to be able to mitigate the risk, spend and burn on the company P&L overall, but still have the ability to grow these areas effectively. Make the right investments from portfolio standpoint is the reason why were looking at all three areas. Thats not to say that we will necessarily do each, but we are exploring each to see what’s the best way is to maximize value for the company by mitigating the P&L.",

So, it will operate very much like Generics from my perspective. Their time to market is going to be key and cost of manufacturing is going to be key. The companies that really are in the first wave of launches are going to be the ones that will succeed the most. I think just given the focus on bringing the cost down, youre going to see a pricing pressure also on the biosimilars just like any other generics. One will have to continuously bring in products, pipeline that offset the price erosion in all the products and ensure that strong focus on cost of goods to stay long-term. August 11, 2021",

I think our pipeline, weve consciously tried to stay away from the conventional products on the injectable side, focusing on the ones which do have some level of challenge. I think the depot injections are the furthest end of the challenge. There too we have products in the clinic now.

      "content": "Thank you Dr Sharma and welcome back friends. Hope that you and your family are keeping fine. Ill begin with the commentary on the sales. Sales for Q2 FY22 are INR 40.03 billion as compared to INR 42.37 billion in Q1 FY22, a 5.5% degrowth and 5.9% growth as compared to Q2 FY21 sales. You’d recognize that adjusted for NCE licensing income in Q1 FY22, the QoQ growth is 3.6%, whilst the YoY growth is 5.9%. U.S. sales grew by 7.2% sequentially, at US$184 million in Q2 FY22 as compared to US$172 million in Q1 FY22 and grew by 2.2% YoY as compared to US$180 million in Q2 FY21. The QoQ increase was driven by the increase in the sales of our respiratory franchise led by incremental sales of albuterol and full quarter sales of Brovana AG. The India region saw a QoQ degrowth of 5.7% due to higher Covid second wave driven sales in Q1 and 16% YoY growth on the Covid impacted base in Q2 last year. India region sales were higher than the market growth rate across both the acute and chronic therapy areas, but were impacted by higher salience of chronic therapies, which grew at a slower pace. For API sales, QoQ growth at 8.9% was driven by higher quetiapine sales to Kyowa. Core API business was flat QoQ but down YoY due to lower volumes and demand. Sales for EMEA grew by 33.3% QoQ and 6.9% YoY due to higher sales across all markets as Covid restrictions are gradually easing. We also launched Luforbec i.e. generic of Fostair in Q2 in the U.K. market. Sales for growth markets grew by 4.9% QoQ and 19.6% YoY due to continued recovery in almost all markets - Mexico, Philippines and Australia. We have had some exceptional items this quarter, as you would recognize. One-time costs related to U.S. specialty restructuring of about INR 326 million, of which INR 200 million is under the manufacturing and other expenses and about INR 126 million in employee benefit schemes. We provided for the Glumetza antitrust class action suit and that has been included in the results. There is also the impairment expense of INR 7,077 million thats essentially related to the Solosec IP. October 28, 2021 The normalized operating EBITDA excluding Forex, other income and one-offs - that’s the NCE income in Q1 and specialty restructuring in Q2, moved up from 14.3% in Q1 FY22 to 14.9% in Q2 FY22. A positive impact of lower R&D, employee benefit expenses were offset by the fall in gross margins as well as an increase in SG&A expenses largely due to promotion, travel and plant operating expenses as well. Within Gross margins, royalty/profit-sharing expenses on certain in-licensed partnered products have been reclassified from Q1 FY22. On a comparable basis, the gross margin adjusted for such change would have been 62.7% of sales in Q2 FY21. Q2 FY22 gross margins was 59.4% as compared to Q1 FY22 gross margins adjusted for NCE licensing income of 60.5%. This is mainly due to the decline in API margins and offset by positive impact of higher U.S. sales and lower GIB sales. YoY drop from 62.7% to 59.4% is on account of impact of higher royalty expenses, lower U.S. margins offset by positive revaluation impact. Employee benefit expenses is expected to normalize around 18%. We expect R&D to be around 8 - 8.5% going forward. The ETR is on expected lines and is expected to be less than 30% for FY22. With this, may I open the floor for the discussions.",

We now believe that with the current nonpersonal promotion strategy, we should be able to at least hold the current scripts at where they are, if not grow. Likewise, we have multiple pipeline programs that we have developed on the womens health front. We are pretty far along in getting those pipeline programs funded by partners. So, in effect, what we have done is reduce the current burn from specialty but retained the optionality to build specialty in the future.

That’s really taken away the litigation risk. Weve got a very favorable date that we will look forward to disclosing in the future. We are working right now towards getting the product approved.

We have always grown 20% to 30% more than the market, and the goal is to continue doing that on the Rx side of the business. The diagnostic foray is a full rollout. It is a national play. But it will be calibrated, it will be stage gated. There are key metrics that have to be met as we decide how and if to scale it up as well. I would wait for it to roll out.

The IQVIA reflection is what it is. The acute side is really what has driven growth through the Covid period. It continues to be an important part. Its coming down, it came down in Q2, its going to come down even more in Q3 to Q4 as well. We made a conscious decision to focus on chronic therapies, probably some 20 years ago. I think its reaped rich rewards. In our entire peer set, the amount that we draw from chronic is the highest. We believe that means sticky, sustainable growth. Our goal very clearly on the chronic side is to grow 20% - 30% higher than the market growth rate. There is a slowdown, especially with the Covid period, there was definitely a slowdown. For example, respiratory was a terrible slowdown last year, its come back with a big bang at this point of time. Diabetes seems to be slow at this point of time. We believe that its possibly a function of patient footfalls. Again, patient footfalls are back, so we would expect for this to pick up. We would continue to do 20% - 30% more. I think the hypothesis remains the same, the focus is there on the chronic therapies. There are other chronic therapies where were not as strong. For example, in CNS or in gastro, our goal would be to build in those spaces as well. They are all great growth areas, still an extremely fragmented market and a lot of room for growth",

Our lead October 28, 2021 product was Etanercept, which is approved in Japan and Europe. One day it will come to the U.S. when the patent expires. Our first lead product to the U.S. is peg-G, which we filed. Its going through the review process nicely. We dont see any showstoppers right now. A key milestone is going to be a likely inspection of the facility, theres some to and fro on when that might happen. The next product is ranibizumab, which is in development. Theres a global clinical trial underway, ran slower on account of Covid, but again we hope to ramp that up going forward. There are 2 - 3 new products which are in the earlier stages of development in the pipeline as well. With the way that Lupin is able to fund this, obviously there is a constraint on how many of these projects we can finance. Vinita talked last quarter about a spinout of, one was the oncology, the second was likely the biosimilars, the third was also taking care of the specialty expense. So, weve done the specialty expense. Were on the way on the oncology spin out as well. The biosimilar spinout is certainly something that stays on the table as a discussion item. We do hope to be able to action that. I think that would free up the way for a lot more portfolio expansion, not necessarily waiting for a funding partner to tie up on a project-by-project basis and it will give a lot of latitude to development. But in the meanwhile, we cherry pick. We do 2 or 3 products at a point of time, likely 1 or 2 products in the clinic. At any point of time, we have great capability on the R&D, manufacturing, drug substance, drug product side, on the regulatory side. There is great capability to be used globally as far as biosimilar is concerned. It is going to be a good growth opportunity. But I think the financing story has to still play out.",

We also have a follow-on for pegfilgrastim, the Onpro biosimilar. Were going to have both pegfilgrastim as well as the Onpro biosimilar. Theres going to be a timing gap. We will assess whether it make sense to try to club them together to be able to leverage the commercial investment or launch pegfilgrastim ahead of the on-body product. We hope that we have the opportunity to launch next fiscal year. Like Nilesh mentioned, its going to depend on the inspection. The agency has already informed us that they will have to inspect the site. Well wait for that milestone to pass and then determine the right timing to set up commercial infrastructure. October 28, 2021 Ill also say that the commercial infrastructure for biosimilars has synergies with our injectables institutional portfolio. We are simultaneously building our injectables portfolio as well, both internally through our pipeline as well as through partnerships, through in-licensing.

Our team has done a really good job in building the baseline back again. So, youll see a better baseline. The older in-line products and then really ramp up of albuterol and Brovana AG for our contracted volume, contracted customers and then executing some of the new product launches. We have a few like Sevelamer, we expect to launch fairly soon. We have a couple more products that well have the opportunity to launch. Then we have our partnered products, for which I know we dont like the impact on the gross margin, but on a net basis, significant contribution to our profitability.

Revenue for Lupin grew 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven primarily by U.S growth of 10.4%, driven in turn by, strong growth of albuterol, where we now have a 20% market share. Year-on-year, we registered 4.3% growth, driven by majority of our markets, U.S. 9%, and IRF 12% (overall India region 8%), along with others like Australia 13%. Gross margins were down by 0.9% QoQ primarily due to increase in the input material cost, sales mix, and higher U.S. sales. Employee cost is down 2%, quarter-on-quarter at 18.2% of net sales, primarily due to the savings realized, with the specialty restructuring in the U.S.. This despite providing for additional sales incentives in India linked to performance. Manufacturing and other expenses were higher by 18.3%, quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to the one-time charge of about $26 million or INR193 crores. We reviewed U.S. provisions and determined that there was a need to further increase the same, to properly reflect the impact of some one-time items, that we experienced over the last two years. That is the unusual high volumes returns from a 2020 patient level recall of Metformin and slow-moving flu medication at wholesalers’ warehouses. Other income is down 53%, primarily due to interest on tax refund, earned in quarter two, and this is obviously not there in quarter three. EBITDA adjusted for the one-time charge of $26 million or INR193 crores, was at INR564 crores flat quarter- on- quarter. The adjusted EBITDA of 13.7% versus 14.1% sequentially. Given the exceptional items taken at Lupin standalone accounts, the bottom line for the first nine-months comes up negative, warranting a write back of the taxes provided till date. The ETR for the full year, for the company should be about 30% to 32%. Given the tax being paid in certain geographies, despite the lower PBT on a consolidated basis. For the next two to three quarters, we see margin slowly moving up in the 14% levels. The next couple of quarters, EBIDTA improvement will come largely from the optimization efforts and there are several initiatives in advanced stages, including tight management of FTS, our returns, write-offs, freight charges and plant idle cost. Some of the near-term drivers of February 4, 2022 growth, are going to be Suprep, Peg G-CSF, Tiotropium and growth in India and other geographies. We see meaningful uptick in H2 FY23 and then FY24, we see the real growth drivers kicking in, with full impact of our inhalations’ portfolio, injectables’ portfolio, and biosimilars which will deliver higher numbers and commensurate gain to the margins and EBITDA levels to move up to about 20% plus. Friends would also be happy to know that, we have completed our acquisition of a Bolt-on in Australia, called the Southern Cross. And further add the numbers going forward, Ill tell you the full story and other issues, I would open the floor for discussions. With this, may I open the floor for the discussions.",

And to that extent, we certainly see a blip-up coming up in so far as gross margins are concerned.

      "content": "Yeah. So, thank you for the question, because I think, when you start looking at it from a three- year perspective, one can also look at all of the results of the efforts that we have put in over the last many years. And on the one hand, while were going through the inflection from the simpler genetics to complex generics right now with albuterol and inhalation portfolio and seeing the business kind of stabilize right now, we would like to be able to deliver a higher level of revenues and margin growth, but just given that we have just albuterol and Brovana, small Fostair is still not a contributor, we see this transitioning over the next couple of years, as we see the full impact of inhalation pipeline, as we see the full impact of, well, that you havent seen much impact of our injectables portfolio, but have really great filings at this point with products like glucagon, ganirelix, and the like, and more coming. And products like pegfilgrastim that we hope to launch in FY23 and have a full-year impact on FY24. As an organization, we are not nervous about increasing the U.S. revenues. I mean, we have the potential of growing in the U.S. outpacing other markets with product that are going to be more profitable than our baseline products. Already we are seeing that the albuterol margins are, inhalation product margins are higher than obviously the oral solid margins. And as that component of the business changes and revenues grow, we should be able to grow both the company top line with the contribution of the U.S. as well, as margins. Id say that the revenue mix should roughly be the same. There shouldnt be a material shift we have I mean, very solid growth, double-digit growth in India, on a consistent basis, we expect to continue that years to come and the U.S. will start with the next fiscal year half-year impact. So, a lower growth level, but a higher growth level in FY24 and FY25, but roughly the same level, same mix of the major businesses. The other businesses also, the other markets, February 4, 2022 we are working on growing scale and operating leverage in the most prudent manner. So, but they are smaller at this point relative to the U.S. and India.",

I mean, we have, from optimization standpoint worked on multiple areas so far the right sizing the U.S. team as well as looking at any other areas of revenue or profit leakage, whether its FTS or returns and write-offs. A big part of operating leverage is also going to come from plants which, right now are due to all of the challenges that we have had in the last couple of years with OAIs and the fact that new product launches have struggled. We see that the idle cost in the plants have dont have gone up significantly and has really burdened the P&L quite a bit. But with the efforts that we have underway on the optimization in idle cost as well as continued increase in volumes from the products, that now with Goa having cleared the FDA this last quarter, we expect seven launches out of Goa, not big launches, not like Suprep and Spiriva, but still contributing to revenues and reducing idle costs on top of our optimization efforts on plant overheads and idle cost. So, youre going to see more of that operating leverage coming both from the optimization efforts as well as continued increase in volumes with new product launches.",

First of all, I do want to say this on the U.S. So, I think while we need a little bit of a breather, we feel pretty good about some of the growth drivers that were putting in place in the U.S. and while were over the $200 million number right now, some of it is coming from these partner products and the like, obviously the margin profile there is different from our own portfolio. So as the inline portfolio picks up, as the Cefs pick up, as more of Goa and other products come to market, I would expect that the U.S. margin profile could improve. On India, I think thats our second biggest market. Obviously, a market we bank on, a market in which we are in number six, obviously there is significant headroom to grow. Anubhav you know our focus has been on the chronic side, the market is two-thirds acute, one-third chronic, we are the opposite by design. And we have two therapies, over INR1,000 crores, we have another therapy over INR500 crores and so much headroom to grow. On the chronic side, were number four, while overall were numbers six, we add the opened up one new division last year. There is a program few hundred representatives that we keep adding each here, so next will be an additional respiratory division and other divisions as well as. February 4, 2022 I think were still under indexed in multiple therapy areas, like dermatology for example, or even in the CNS space, there is room to grow. So, lots of room to grow. As you know, I think were starting a little bit in acquisitions India as well. So, we talked about Anglo-French. Obviously, we hope to close that soon. So, a lot of headroom to grow and were obviously pushing to grow. Were also exploring adjacencies, like diagnostics early days, right now. But I would say that, I think on the U.S. complex generics, thats where we press the accelerator, on optimization, we press the accelerator as well, and on the India region, we obviously press the accelerator as well, so all three are going strong.",

Especially, when it comes to manpower, its not an easy question to solve, it could take time, and thats one of the reasons why we said for the next couple of quarters, next three quarters, you could expect the lackluster results. And things would certainly look-up after, towards the third or fourth quarter of next year.",

I think we have invested in more platforms that have yet to deliver. I mean whether it is the, I mean, so inhalational is started to, injectables has yet to, biosimilars has yet to in the material manner, specialty obviously we optimized, NCE we want to spin out. But right now the investment is, the number is within our R&D spent. So, Id say higher R&D spend and as Ramesh said also, high investments in facilities, some of which again for these products for the future, but some idle cost that has gathered over time that due to new product launches not happening due to our OAI warning letter status. So, that portion, we are correcting, of course, but as we continue to really launch a product from the new February 4, 2022 platforms and our optimization efforts, when we look at FY24 for example, when we have Albuterol, Tiotropium, Pegfilgrastim, few products are not just one or two, but three, four products, five products on the complex front in the market. We really see both from a revenue and gross margin pricing standpoint that upside as well as capacity utilization standpoint operating leverage.",

I think we have warning letters started with Goa, so its only fair that they should end with Goa, heralding that. I think, youre absolutely right, I think the issues that had in Goa were similar to what has been sighted in the past as well. And I think, Im very glad that the agency seems to have noted the steps that weve taken. And I dont think were done with that. I think we see that were clearly on the right path, especially as far as investigations are concerned. And that is the same system that they would see at any of our other sites as well. February 4, 2022 Obviously, each inspection is different, its a different set of investigators who would come, we already know that there is not going to be remote audits. So, I think Omicron has played a little bit of spoilsport on the inspections. So, I think its possibly a few months before which you can expect predictably inspection starting again. And but were ready, as far as Pithampur is concerned, or Tarapur is concerned. Were ready. Its the same system in those obviously we remediated on the other items that were highlighted in the past. So, I feel much more confident. The confidence that I get from our team is much more. I think our team did it well, clearly Goa points that were moving in the right direction. And then now we would want to get even better at things like investigations and what we already are. So, I think were moving in the right direction. We have a stated goal in the next 18 months to clear all our sites. And I hope that were going to be able to deliver on that.",

      "content": "So, I think, the one good thing is that the railroad drivers theyve all been protected. Theyve all been inspected separately and all those inspections have gone through fine. So, if you see inhalation, for example or even smaller platforms like Derm, for example, biosimilar records still needs to be really inspected as does injectables. But these problems that we had on the oral solids at sites like Pithampur Unit 2 or Goa or even on API interface with Tarapur, didnt translate into disrupting that kind of growth. So, I think the bigger products are protected anyway, and its a question of time to be able to deliver them, like Vinita said Suprep will be sooner, Tiotropium will be a little later, but its all coming together in H2. You do see that increase happening. Theres some 20 odd products that will get launched from Goa over time about 7 or 10 of them are ones which were really stuck only for site related issues. The others have some more things as well. So, those will come, like, Vinita said, theyre not going now be big products. But I think its those couple of million dollars that you get from each of these products that helps grow the business. Weve had a We’ve had a pitiful launch story and I think thats really vitiated the nature of the generic business in the U.S. And I think its high time that we get that back on track. The backlog in Pithampur Unit 2 is even more than what Goa had. So, were looking forward to that clearing and then starting to get more approvals from there as well.",

One, we have really de-risked our P&L for the womens health, right, from a commercial perspective and have partnered Solosec with a really good womens health company and Exeltis that has 120 people sales force. Thats what we had at peak, when in the first year Solosec was what tracking at $10 plus million in revenues, so were very hopeful that with the kind of strength that they bring to Solosec we will be able to do justice to the product and decent level of revenues, and profitability February 4, 2022 obviously to be shared with them, for the fact that they are putting the promotional effort behind it. So, one is that on the commercial front. Second, we have builds capabilities on the R&D front, on the technology front and IUDs, implants and rings and have three products in development right now that will continue to pursue. And they will take time because each of them is a drug device combination. Implants, rings require clinical studies. So, it takes a little bit of time. It will take two years, but we see the potential of getting these products to market, within a four-year time frame. So that is one on the womens health front. Third, we are looking at other platforms, we have our neurology product Namuscla in Europe. Were looking at the potential of bringing it into the U.S. market. Fourth, looking at respiratory, which is now become the largest part of our business in the U.S. with Albuterol and Brovana to look at areas of unmet needs where we can bring in our own products from organic R&D standpoint. And fifth, on the injectable front, where there is tremendous opportunity and the companies like Eagle and others have capitalized with the capabilities that we have now developed around injectables and peptides and colloids and long-acting injectables. We expect to bring in some innovative products. In fact, we have partnered with a company on NDA for Fosphenytoin, which is going to be our first 505(b)(2) injectable product. We expect to launch not in FY23, I think it will be tech-transferring in FY23 but in FY24. So, were looking at multiple areas and will continue to be both opportunistic as well as proactive in evolving a pipeline.",

There will be a burn increase, but theyll be more than commensurate increase in the Indian region profitability, that would happen anyway. On Goa, we already had one approval as you know, and that product is getting launched shortly. There are another 6-7 products that we would expect to get approved in the upcoming fiscal and those will get launched as well. And then, I think this approximately about 20 products that are still pending from Goa. On the idle cost, first of all, idle cost is never going to be zero. It obviously needs to be optimized. What has happened right now is demand is significantly down for multiple product categories, the Cefs, for example, both API and finished products for some of the other products as well. And I think that is accentuating the idle cost right. Obviously, the other part is sum of the capacities that weve created for new growth drivers, which are not kicked in. So injectables, for example, which is still not inspected, biotech where its still not adequately utilized. So, those would add to the item idle cost as well. And part of our optimization is going to be increase in revenues of some products to optimally utilize our capacities. But the other is actually going to be workforce planning around some of the plants as well, where we dont see meaningful uptick over time. And that is something that we are expecting to close in the next three to four months after which youll start seeing benefits of that.",

I hope you and your relatives, your family have been keeping safe during this time. The last couple of years have been pretty bad for a lot of families. I hope you have been doing good. Of course, I have been in touch with people about our performance. Youve been posing questions to me from time to time. And of course, we have had our regular investor calls like every quarter and you have already supported us, guided us, assisted us and we should be looking at things and so on. Thank you for that. Again, coming back to the current year performance, happy to take you through our quarterly performance as well as our results for the year itself. Its a smaller crowd out here, but Im sure there are lot of people who are on the call itself, who would potentially be asking us questions because as per the SEBI regulation, I think we need to be live for the rest of the community to interact with us. So I really would be looking forward to questions from those people who are online, so to speak. And Im happy to take this again. So, well begin with the presentation. So, this is our strategic vision. Next slide, please. Go on to the slide after that. This is our strategic vision for us as a company: a global pharma company focused on core growth platforms. As you recognize, we have done extremely well in India over time. As I listened to a lot of you, you have also been telling me that you should really be focusing on India. And just about a few minutes ago, it was very surprising because sort of people are telling me, as I was listening to them, that India is -- your valuation has been captured in India per se, and the rest of the business has not actually been valued. And to that extent, it is surprising in some ways. Im sure there are going to be a lot of questions about some of the parts and how we could take this forward, so theyre talking to me about that. And so we are looking at India very, very seriously, both organic and inorganic growth. And as weve recognized, weve done a stupendous job out here. And we just acquired recently Anglo-French because thats the way forward for a host of products in the years to come as well. As with a lot of other pharma companies, we are also acquiring assets and focusing on a lot of -- number of platforms. So a lot of complex, really complex ones. I spoke about it a few minutes ago also about the fact that we are concentrating so much on complex injectables, on our inhalations portfolio. And let me add biosimilars. And the fact that OSD business is not going to be the focus area. And thats resonated with you as well. From a global perspective, we believe that we need to be absolutely focused on efficiency. There are number of initiatives that we are taking to make ourselves a lot more efficient because there has been tremendous inefficiencies that have crept into the system over the last few years. But we are conscious of that, and were taking all steps to kind of work on that. May 19, 2022 We are also building operating leverage in our CapEx spend, as well as on R&D. Of course, the overall focus would be to really focus on product development cycles for development and to kind of compress that so that we are delivering top-notch launches from time to time. So, it actually helps in leveraging our top line, a continuous improvement culture, sentient culture, if you may. And of course, the global quality class. All of these, of course, are initiatives that weve taken and were really going to focus on. You would like to add to that, Vinita, if you may?",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. So, this is about the industry trends. Youve also noticed that price erosion seems to have become endemic and so far as the American business is concerned. And we spoke about it just about a few minutes ago. In January, in particular, for example, we saw a 7% decline, whilst it accelerated to 16%. You cant obviously take one brush and kind of paint everything across the entire landscape. But the fact is there is -- its really going to be product specific, portfolio specific, but it is there to stay. The second thing that seems to be confronting everybody is secular inflation, inflationary trends across all sectors, across the pharmaceutical sector as well. This obviously puts pressure on our overall margins. And thus, obviously have been perhaps, again, there is tremendous need for looking at low intensity competitive launches. And many times I just spoke about the fact that were going to focus on, in fact, inhalations portfolio, the complex injectables, the biosimilars and possibly even on the OSDs, niche launches, not actually capture what do you think is going to be value for customers as well as for our investors. India business will remain strong. Its always been our focus for several years, and you have seen us grow in strength from time to time. It will certainly be extremely important for us May 19, 2022 going forward as well. So, it will be -- it will encompass both organic as well as inorganic strokes. And the good thing about getting out of Covid is the fact that the FDA would begin worldwide inspections. And with that, it could be a double-edge sword. It could work in our favor because we have a pretty decent pipeline stuck without approvals. But it could also turn to be a double-edge sword and that it could also intensify competition, so to speak. This is where Lupin is today from a market cap perspective. Next slide, please. Its about $4 billion market cap and revenue base is about $2.2 billion, EBITDA about $311 million. People are very familiar with this. Globally, we are the 10th largest generic company. We were higher up the league tables a few years ago, and we are sure we will get back there. The sixth largest Indian pharma company, the third largest in American from a prescriptions perspective. And we are present in several geographies from U.S.A., Mexico, Brazil, India, and we are present in Australia, Philippines, South Africa and a host of other places. Our overall manufacturing footprint is about -- weve got about 15 sites spread across India. And of course, we have plants in America, in Brazil and Mexico. And we have 7 R&D sites, again, across various parts of the globe. Next slide, please. This is a snapshot of what we actually -- how we -- Q4 actually was for us. As you can see, if you look at our performance over the last four quarters, it generally has been ranging between INR3,800 crores and INR4,000 odd crores. Q4, there was actually a decline versus Q3. This was led by, in fact, a slight reduction in India and of course, reduction in America. The reasons for decline in India is because Q4, in a general sense, is always the weakest quarter for India market. You know that traditionally, Q1 and Q2 are very strong for India. Q3 and Q4 are a little tepid in comparison. This time around America, so we -- a number of people raised this question to me in the morning, why have we reached less than $200 million because thats what you had guided for at the beginning of this year in America. But the fact is there has been price decline. This quarter, we were also stuck with, in fact, some one- times. So, in terms of losartan, we had our recall - were not able to sell and that actually -- the turnover and also the fact that there were returns associated with, in fact, the recall itself. So together -- and there was a price decline across a number of products because Brovana, we ran out of exclusivity status also. Levothyroxine and others, there were some -- there was a price reduction. So to that extent, you would also appreciate that the acute therapy range that we have in our portfolio, unfortunately, in the last two years to three years, we have not been able to make a whole lot because acute therapy has not been selling in America or in fact, in most parts of the globe. Then, of course, we talk about other therapy areas, including other SBUs, including API, who still have an issue in terms of acute therapy products, cephalosporins products. So, all of this has taken a toll and to that extent, Q4 has remained a little suppressed, so to speak. And if you look at the EBITDA margin, it has also come down. Theres close to INR127 crores impact only because of the fact that our sales were lower. But apart from that, there was, of course, the impact of several one-times. This is including the losartan recall and the costs associated May 19, 2022 with that. As you might also know, we lost our litigation for Solosec in terms of royalties we paid to the vendor and there were associated litigation costs and the like. So, all this actually took a toll. So, the one-time that actually comes into overall expenditure base. Apart from that, there was a swing from the last quarter because last quarter, there were settlement incomes, and those did not figure in this quarter. So actually, the swing is a little more marked in terms of -- its been a -- this big swing vis-à-vis in the previous quarter. The last was 13.7% on a normalized basis. This time, it came down because the sale as well as the one-times that we took, plus, of course. There were other developments, which are very noteworthy and important. We acquired Anglo-French. It was actually consummated in the first week of April, but important development, obviously. We also expanded -- we had a bolt-on acquisition in Australia, a very important one for us. We announced partnerships, strategic partnerships in China and then, of course, supply arrangements in China again and for other important products for Peg G-CSF and so on. You see the FDA approval for a number of products, 3 products as such. And of course, we had our inspection of our Tarapur facility last quarter. Next slide, please. Vinita, this is really your -- would you like to speak about America?",

      "content": "Sure. Sure. So, I think most of this is known. But if you look at our position in the U.S., certainly, we have a very strong market position with 44 products. We are market leaders. A very heartening development with albuterol. All of you know that we entered a little bit later than our competitors/ our peers in albuterol, but have now got 22.6%, almost 23% market share, so have ramped up very nicely. And when I look at Albuterol, Brovana, now inhalation products are over 25% of the companys -- the U.S. business revenue, a bigger part of the U.S. profitability. So, the transition into complex generics, certainly, in relation, its happening. We need to accelerate it, which we are looking forward to in fiscal year 23 as well as 24. We have material launches into the US. We have a good number of our portfolio. We are in 60 products in the market, 113 products. We are in top three in terms of market share. And a good number of products that are pending. So, from a pipeline perspective, when we compare it with all of our peers, we have one of the richest pipelines, both in terms of number of ANDAs that are pending as well as the complex products that we have above -- within the pipeline that gives us the headroom like Ramesh was saying, based on the conversation with some of you that our market cap pretty much reflects only the India business. We have tremendous upside here with the pipeline that we have built on the complex generics front for the US. On the revenue front, as Ramesh mentioned, we had softness in Q4, in particular, due to a couple of products, Albuterol, primarily phasing. We see Albuterol -- really again, the winter month is the volume is higher and then tapers down. So, we saw some of that, plus we had a regional competition in Brovana. So, we saw the impact of that. And we had the recall of losartan. Those were the three material reasons why revenues were down in May 19, 2022 Q4. And we launched a couple of products. We launched two products, small, though in the scheme of things. Our material products, we expect to really now in the next 12 months, the launch of Suprep into the U.S. And then later on in the fiscal year, we plan to launch Spiriva as well as FDA permitting Pegfilgrastim. So, weve had challenges this past year. Id say its been a year of really making the U.S. business stronger from a processes standpoint, from a balance sheet standpoint. We had a number of one-time impacts of gross to net items like FTS works that we cleaned up as well as returns, inventories for the flu season products like Oseltamivir and cephalosporin. So, we believe that we are in a strong position, but still need new product launches to grow the business. I mean, all of you have been close to the marketplace and the trends in the U.S. Our pricing pressure is still strong, especially on the oral solids. We continue to see double- digit pricing pressure. And so the only way to be able to grow both on revenues as well as profitability is a combination of new product launches and material new product launches, as well as continued cost reduction and optimization and both are a very strong focus for us.",

And were really exploring all kinds of things in India. And well talk about some of that. So, as we fixed the U.S. business, I think the core India business, we definitely want to double down on. The Q4 growth was tepid. We grew at 5%. And then I think thats an industry trend at this point of time, especially the Covid drugs as they come off and the additional market that happened on the Covid counters had come down. You will see sluggishness for the market. Youll see sluggishness for -- youll see even market decline. I think in April; the market is actually declining for the industry. We were not positively impacted by the Covid products; we really didnt have any. And therefore, well not be negatively impacted materially as well. So, it should be good growth. It should be a good growth year as long as Covid doesnt play spoilsport anymore. Hopefully, its behind us. But the India quarterly sales, as you can see, goes as norm Q4 is always weak. You see a high Q1 coming up, thereafter. Year-on-year, yes, last Q1 was big. So from that perspective, you wont see that growth, but youll see that growth in coming quarters as well. Our focus is chronic amongst a peer set where the largest -- our proportion of sales from chronic therapy areas is the largest and that continues. And our big three areas are cardiac, diabetes and respiratory. As you can see from the slide, were growing faster than the market in all three. We are not satisfied with this growth rate. We think we can do better. And May 19, 2022 certainly, FY 23, but the period days beyond as well. You should look at stronger growth coming from Lupin in these therapy areas, but overall for our India business as well. Three brands in the top 100, 8 in the top 300, that statistic has been improving. Again, not satisfied with it. I think there is, again, more room to grow there. Double-digit growth in areas like respiratory and gynecology and were launching new divisions as well. So, we launched three divisions, one for diabetes, one for CNS and one for anti-infectives. Like I said, I think its an extremely fragmented market. Theres a lot of room to grow. Its our home market. The U.S. and India are our 2 home markets. So, we have to do well in both those markets. And certainly, theres a lot of room to grow in India. Ramesh, back to you.",

      "content": "Yes. Thank you. These are the other markets that we are present in. So, essentially, weve made some good progress across various markets. On the EU5, for example, we also -- Fostair was introduced, and we have been ramping up on NaMuscla as well. Australia, we made this acquisition, Southern Cross, which we believe would serve us good in the years to come. South Africa, now the fourth largest generics player, and of course, been a market leader in cardiovascular space for quite some time. Brazil -- so thats been a loss-making unit until very recently, but its turning around pretty nicely for us. Mexico, we are market leader in ophthalmology, number two actually, Sophia is number one. But in terms of values and then in developing a national footprint, we really are going the full hog out there. And of course, API business -- our fortunes have dipped this year essentially because of acute therapy products not selling in most parts. But I understand the JV business continues to do pretty well. Some headwinds in India on the TB front, but overall, still good growth. And as you might know, we are looking at getting kind of broad-basing our overall portfolio of products that we serve for the global institutional business. Next slide, please. The P&L, essentially, this is a snapshot. This was actually provided previously. We spoke about the fact that there has been a slight decline in overall sales. And we also spoke about the reason why there was a decline in overall EBITDA margins. And there are, of course, exceptional items from a write-off perspective also. This time around, we had accelerated amortization of certain intangibles in Gavis, which we took this year. And overall, given the fact that we actually had a huge exceptional items in Q3. We had -- we ended up with the entire year at an overall loss situation. But just to add, that the next two quarters could potentially be -- might have the same lackluster feeling. But the second half of next year onwards, you would actually see a step up in terms of sales, as well as in terms of the margins that go with it. As Vinita was saying, there are a number of products that we are looking at for America over the next several years. And for sure, I think this would begin in Q3 with Suprep and thats something which we already have an approval for. This is again a snapshot of what we spoke May 19, 2022 about. Essentially, the annualization of our annual results for the year, for the company. And I guess its something that we just spoke about in terms of the exceptional items, making this a very exceptional year in some ways. Next slide, please. Yes. R&D, as you can see, its been running steady at around INR350 crores, INR375 crores mark, so to speak, and now its around the 8% mark. But more importantly, the character of R&D is shifting. As Vinita was also saying, it is going to be more -- a lot more focus on complex generics, so its going to be inhalations and the injectables and biologics all the way -- biosimilars all the way. And of course, the salience of NCE would certainly come down over time. Theres been a tight rein on overall capital expenditure. As you can see, we used to -- it used to be in the INR1,800 crores range. Its hovering around the INR600 crores mark, but theres a lot of impetuses on reining in the CapEx cost expenditure outlays. And of course, from being a cash surplus company, there is a slight increase in overall debts. Theres tremendous scope for potentially working on working capital optimization. Its around 145 days currently, and we and my team are working on optimizing on that. It turned out to be a debt situationally because the fact that we had to pay up the settlements related to Glumetza, but that is one- time. Its a question of time if we kind of get back into the surplus situation until we actually start using it for productive purposes, including M&A. And thats something that we are saying, youll be looking at in India and worthwhile acquisitions in other parts also. Next slide, please. Really, your slide, Vinita. If you want to talk about complex generics, youre passionate about it.",

      "content": "So -- again, this is continuing on the same theme. We have already started monetizing our inhalation platform with products like albuterol that we have monetized in the US. Now a solid product for us. And some of these platforms, as you can see from the flags that we put in there are geographic. We have the potential of leveraging across multiple geographies. So, on the inhalation front, we also launched Fostair recently as said in U.K. and have plans to launch other inhalation products in U.K. and Europe as well, as well as China. So, the inhalation platform has started and in the next couple of years will really become a material part of our business, as well as geographical spread. I mean right now, we have albuterol, but looking at the next 12 months, Spiriva and then Dulera and Fostair. We have Qvar, the next wave of DPIs, MDIs, the Ellipta products, the Respimat products, all in the development on the inhalation front. On the biosimilars front, again, multiple geographies that we are addressing. And the focus has shifted from, of course, our first program, pegfilgrastim, for the US, which were looking forward to bringing to market soon, the products where we can be in the first phase, where we are in first or second to launch and have the potential of really getting major upside as well as a strong long-term position. On the injectables front, after inhalation and biosimilars in fiscal year 24, we will see material launches coming through. Weve had a number of complex filings. This past year, we have had our first peptide filing on the products like ganirelix, products like glucagon, our Risperdal Consta on the depot front, thats pretty far along. We hope to be the first company to file a 505(j) for Risperdal Consta and so on and so forth. So, material pipeline, complex product pipeline on the injectables front. On the womens health front, weve made significant progress on the drug device combinations. Products like Nexplanon and Mirena, weve already got proof-of-concept and have put these products into the clinic. Again, from a timing perspective, its inhalation now, biosimilars next, injectables soon thereafter and womens health in the 4-year to five-year time frame. Next slide, please.",

      "content": "Yes. So on the biosimilars front, of course, we started with Enbrel that we launched in Japan and then Europe through a partnership with Mylan. That continues to evolve. Mylan continues to launch in multiple countries, and we expect our share to build over the next 12 months to 24 months with Etanercept. The U.S. is still long away, still 2029. But needless to say, we have reserved rights of the product for the U.S. market. Pegfilgrastim, while we are a late entrant on Pegfilgrastim, really, for us, we will start learning the market through it. And hope that in the next 12 months, we get inspected by the FDA and well plan to launch the product. Were very pleased with our position actually on the on-body Onpro product, where we seem to be one of three and potentially in the first wave. Our customers are very, very keen to see us in the market with that product. So, we think we will really grow pegfilgrastim materially with the launch of Onpro, which is 10 months behind the pre-filled syringe but its going to be a material anchor for us on the biologics front. Lucentis is well under -- when we had some delays in the clinical trial with Covid, but now its well underway. And again, very strong partnership position in the U.S. that weve already established for Lucentis. Well share more as we come closer to the opportunity. And right after that is Eylea. So, on the ophthalmic front, both Lucentis and Eylea are going to be material opportunities for us that we would leverage through the channels that we have established relationships with. And then we have programs earlier stage in the pipeline that we are pursuing.",

So as I was telling people, there is a lot of things that we would pursue and there are lot of inefficiencies that have crept up in the system over the last few years. So, we are working on all of this. There is, of course, considerable idle time because we programmed for a lot more capacity utilization and went ahead with a lot of capacity expansion at various -- in the factories, both the API and formulation. So, there is considerable idle time out there, which we want to clear. It obviously would be coming down on expenses, perhaps footprint, addressing the manning background in various parts and the like. So, we are doing a lot of stuff on that front. We also May 19, 2022 know that there is a lot of write-offs in the system because weve been dropping products. Demand has been coming down and the like. So, theres a lot of scope for reduction of retarders, value eroders, if you may. And were working on this as well. Given our supply chain issues and OAI status and so on, we also had issues on airfreighting. So, ideally, if you go back about five years ago, 100% of our products would have been ocean freighted, so to speak. But over the last few years, there has been a considerable element of air freighting, which has been happening. We would like to pull down on that -- claw back on that and go down to ocean freighting and that would mean considerable savings on that score. There are, of course, returns associated with the -- there are various kinds of costs. The returns were essentially because of product recalls and the like and normal returns. I think there is scope for optimization on that in India, as well as in America. Were working on that. This might seem like an anomaly. Whilst we have idle time, we have also a failure to supply, which has actually, again, eroded our bottom line tremendously over the last couple of years. We believe that if you were to pull up -- go back on all of this, save on all of this, optimize on all of this, including pulling back on low-margin SKUs, there is considerable scope for improvement in our overall performance. I think the figure rest anywhere between INR500 crores to INR1,000 crores. So, it really depends on how much we can pull back on and how fast can we do that. So thats one of the things that we are taking on as a company, and youd like to expedite this, not -- actually to deliver good results for ourselves, live up to our potential and deliver for our shareholders. This would obviously mean optimizing on the network, optimizing on the R&D front and looking at the entire business at an integrated fashion, and weve got the right technology tools to kind of work on this as well. R&D optimization, would you like to speak on this, Vinita / Nilesh?",

Clearly, the size of the prize on the oral solids has come down, and the optimization is largely in line with that. But our key initiatives on the inhalation side, the injectable side, we are pursuing. Biosimilars, I think were still cherry picking. The idea is to have products that come in the first wave. Etanercept was different. But -- and I think we learned a lot through. But if you sort of look at the rest of the pipeline, that is intended to be first to market or one of two or three players in all. So, the optimization on the R&D, we feel good with this number. And I think were going to be able to stick with this kind of number for the foreseeable future. Or well possibly bring it down a tad even. But I think were seeing all the right opportunities that there are. May 19, 2022 Obviously, I think we have a wealth of portfolios and platforms to work with. But the filings that we have are huge as well. So 457 filings to-date. Theres still another 160 pending approval and a bunch of first to files as well.

      "content": "Yes. So, I can speak. Lets start with the industry first. So, I think the big industry part is, there was definitely a hiatus of inspections in the last two years. And obviously, the FDA is now ramping up inspections within the country. And were going to get mixed outcomes basis, basis that -- basis of the readiness of the individual company. May 19, 2022 I would say for Lupin, just because of the geographical location, I would say that the India plants are operating under one leadership structure and one set of principles. The overall SOPs and are all the same, but I think local implementation, there might be some nuances, which will be there. We had some leadership gaps in Somerset, both in manufacturing and quality. And I think both of those led and both of those positions have been replaced and filled back. We are not happy with what came out of Somerset, but I think Tarapur is representative. So, I think, obviously, we had certain observations. We were able to address them to satisfaction with the FDA. And we would certainly hope that Tarapur goes the same way. Weve sent in our response, end of this month. Next week, well send in an update as well, basis which we should see the outcome of that inspection. And then thats what I would expect for the other inspections as well. Were very clear that we have to get across this compliance rut that weve had. Its been going on for 5 years. And I think what we have set up is pretty solid at the OpEx level from a governance perspective, bringing in people like Diana in the US. I think that is a great opportunity for our people to learn to be -- to become best-in-class as well. So were committed. I think we -- its there in the comment. Its an aspiration. Were certainly not best-in-class at this point in time, but we know that we need to be best-in-class to be a strong generic company. And for the India plants, I think were there. We have inspections, obviously, which will come up for Pithampur unit 2, and for Mandideep. These should go the same way as well. And Somerset, I think theres a very clear plan on remediation as well. Again, we had a set of observations. We had a set of observations. Again, our track record does not speak well for Somerset. But the team is extremely motivated to fix it, and this is kind of their opportunity now. They need to fix this now. And weve given them the tools. We have the people, certainly whatever resources that they need as well. We should come out of these now.",

      "content": "So, there has been a lot of churn actually on the management and leadership level. When I think about both in U.S. as well as India, we face a challenge. Market has been tough. And one -- so we wanted to change ourselves like in Somerset, Nilesh mentioned, the Head of Operations was a position that we changed and brought in someone very solid from Teva to lead the site at the manufacturing level. And on the quality front as well, we felt -- there we had a turnover and then we brought in a person from the outside. And continuity becomes a problem when you have that kind of churn. So, we have faced it. At the same time, weve always tried to scale up when weve had turnover. And now when I look at some of our G&A functions in the US, I mean, when you look at finance, for example, HR, IT, all of them have turned over. But we have, again, scaled up. We brought in capabilities that have helped us clean up a lot of our baggage from the past. For example, the FTS cleanup that you have seen in the year, unfortunately, it hits the P&L now, but as a cleanup that should have happened over the last couple of years. Likewise, the May 19, 2022 processes that the team are now very, very strong going forward for the organization. So in the last year, weve also focused a lot on really putting in contemporary processes. We found that some of our basic processes for supply chain, which is crucial for a generic business were challenged. They were antiquated, to be honest. They were set 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and we had a need to really revisit them so that we can really be better in terms of predicting what our next six months, next 12 months, next 24 months looks like and take proactive decisions to get out of product or to manage the failure to supply penalties in a strategic manner. And we have done that. We implemented IBP in the company this past year for the U.S. Right now, we are doing it ex U.S. for all of the developed markets and then the rest of the company. So, we are -- we have taken the time in the last 12 months to really set in very, very strong processes. So, of course, at the end of the day, leadership and people drive the success, but processes are equally important for a company to scale up.",

So, first of all, people within Lupin, obviously, and people within the industries, but I think they get it. I think they see that -- thats the one big area that needs to be fixed. I couldnt help, but smile when you asked that question because I think were obviously able to attract all the talent that we would want. And attrition has always been a part of this industry. Its always going to be a part going forward as well. Obviously, people like to be part of a winning team. People see that there is this period where there is -- where there are challenges that we need to work through. So obviously, we talked about optimization on R&D, on manufacturing and the like. But we also talked about a very clear pipeline that we will deliver on. I think the complex generics pipeline that Lupin delivers, obviously, thats completely getting discounted at this point of time. And I think we have to reflect that into results. But people who work closer they see it, right? So they see products coming into the pipeline. They see products going into the clinic, approvals, launches. We have an extremely motivated team.

So, if you can like handle and give some more granular details, like youve talked about INR500 crores to INR1,000 crores in terms of pipeline. And you had mentioned five or six areas like idle time and failure to supply. If you can quantify those, so that we can sort of have a greater handle as to what to look forward to, because its very unclear as to from a single-digit margins, well travel up to 20%, right? So, theres no anchor out there. So, if you can really help us and guide us like to how should we build our model as we look forward?",

Were doing what it takes to kind of reduce the idle time out there. First, of course, the footprint and the manpower redressal, all of this is part of that. Maybe what it takes to bring down May 19, 2022 inventories, monitoring it more closely. The FTS is more under control right now. We are trying to move out of -- its an iterative process, moving out of, in fact, low-margin products and the like. And there are issues like airfreighting. So thats focusing on -- especially if theres capacity expansion required for that particular product, we would go down that drought or look at how else can we actually build up inventory. So, we come out of that as well. There a lot of fires -- lot of irons in the fire. I cant go down the path of -- actually quantifying initiatives. All of those put together would come to that. Theres, of course, some inefficiency when it comes to, for example, our make us as buy decisions on API itself. We are addressing that as well. So, all of that will get this done when it comes to recruitment that were speaking about. In terms of the results, we believe a huge chunk of it will potentially land up during the course of the next fiscal. So it could be upward of INR450 crores, INR500 crores, so to speak, and potentially the balance over the next one year. So even if you were to with the -- coupled with, in fact, the top line leveraging that were speaking about, the products coming in and the like, the exit run rate should be pretty -- exit run rate for next fiscal that is. This fiscal, sorry, FY 23, should be kind of reflective of what we can look forward to in the years to come. And this will be more representative of what we have achieved in the past as well.",

You already have seen the results, but as a comment on the outset, Id like to say that, measures to improve overall operational efficiency and improve on our business structure have been in full swing. Im aware that the numbers dont reflect them as yet, but team is absolutely confident that from next quarter onwards, we would definitely see positive reflection of the efforts that are being put in by the team. With those few opening remarks, I would now hand over to our CFO, Mr. Swaminathan, who will walk you through the details of the financial results. Thank you, and over to you, Ramesh.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr Sharma. Friends, in our previous investor call, after the Q4 results, we did guide for a fact that the results for the first two or three quarters could be a little muted, so in line with that, the actual results for the quarter were in line with expectations in that sense. Sales for Q1 FY23 are at INR 3,604 crores as compared to INR 3,864 crores in Q4 FY22. Its a 6.7% quarter-on-quarter decline and year-on-year basis, also declined by 14.9% as compared to Q1 FY22. Our sales excluding the US revenues were higher by 5.9% sequentially and 2.5% year-on-year. When it comes to the US business, during the quarter, the US sales took a significant dip of 33% from $181 million in Q4 FY22 to $121 million in Q1 FY23 as the company took certain strategic decisions to pave the way for building sustainable and profitable business in the US. Firstly, the last few years we have been experiencing huge stock returns on account of higher inventory levels in the trade. During the quarter, we ensured that the inventory levels across our key products are brought down at normalized levels, creating a significant impact in the quarterly sales. The pricing erosion in FY22 has brought down the margins of certain products to single digit to negative territory. The company decided to discontinue some of these products with low and negative margins, which impacted our sales. However, it equally gave us an opportunity to optimize workforce in manufacturing plant in India, the benefits of which will start to flow in the next quarter. We continue to witness double-digit price erosion in this quarter as well coupled with shelf stock adjustment on the higher trade inventory creating a August 4, 2022 dent to the quarter numbers. While surprising erosion can be off set through new launches which we expect to come through in H2 FY23, the first two initiatives have impacted the quarter, but will help us to build focus on building a strong and profitable portfolio in the long run. We continue to build albuterol market share, which improved to 23.2% in Q1 vis-a-vis 22.8% in the previous quarter. Turning to the India business, India branded formulations business posted a growth of 9.9% in Q1 FY23 versus Q4 FY22 though declined on year-on-year basis by 2.9%, given FY22 Q1 had a positive impact on COVID wave 2 in India. API, recovery in API sales in Q1 quarter-on-quarter sales growth at 15.8%. On year-on-year basis, business posted a growth of 3.7%. EMEA year-on-year growth of 27.6% with strong performance by NaMuscula, Luforbec, etanercept sales to Mylan. NaMuscula growth is about 91% versus the previous year, quarter one that is. Sales for Q1 FY23 sales was INR 24.5 crores. In South Africa, Efferflu C holds 48% market share, up from 31% held pre- COVID. When you talk about the growth markets, Philippines year-on-year basis growth 20% with TB kits sales impacting about 9% approximately, better performance in Furic and Lupimet. In Australia, sales grew by 22.4% quarter- on-quarter and year-on-year by 49%, mainly due to the acquisition by Southern Cross. In Mexico, sales grew by 15.9% quarter-on-quarter and year- on-year growth was 30% as ophthal business continues to grow at 26%. In Brazil, quarter-on-quarter declined by 9.5%, year-on-year declined by 8.5%. Azithromycin and Dipimed grew well. When you come to the gross margins, Q1 FY23 is 55.3% as compared to the previous quarter, which is 57.8%. This is mainly due to a price erosion in America to create inventory normalization that I just spoke about and of course the shelf stock adjustment. There is of course impact of cost inflation also, which is actually there in the gross margin line. When you talk about employee benefits, Q1 FY23 is INR 778 crores vis-a-vis INR 703 crores in the previous quarter, and this is essentially because the previous quarter also had an adjustment in terms of taking some part of the expenditure in other expenses. There is of course the impact of increments which were rolled out in FY23 which came in the quarter one. There is of course workforce planning at the plant level which impacted about 14% of the workforce and there would be savings from there, which should start flowing from Q2. On an ongoing basis, we expect employee cost to be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. On the EBITDA front, operating EBITDA excluding FX and other income is 4.5% in Q1, a decline in EBITDA by 140 basis points, led by drop in sales due August 4, 2022 to trade inventory normalization, shelf stock adjustment in the US, price erosion, and on account of discontinuing products during the quarter. R&D expenditure is about INR 348 crores vis-a-vis 342 crores in the previous quarter. The ETR is expected to be around 35% as few subsidiaries are still making losses. In terms of the working capital, its increased to 147 days from 140. However, we are working on this and we would like to bring it down in the quarters to come. With the short commentary, may I open the floor for discussions.",

We had couple of products stuck that we were tech transferring into other sites and we expect these products to get approved in the near term. So apart from Suprep, we think that couple of the other niche products like we have diazepam gel, that is small but nice niche product that we likely can get approval for in the next six months. Likewise, we have a nasal spray where we are first to file Nascobal. It doesnt help us this fiscal year, but its June next fiscal year. And we have exclusive first to file on that one, so we will likely get approval for that one as well.

But as we transition to out of the legacy OSD business, which we think is actually on a weaker footing at this stage in America on to more complex generics, you would expect the margin profile, the realizations to be much better, the margin profile to increase. We are also stepping out of August 4, 2022 our OAI status across the plants, so to the extent our ability to come out of the products is certainly going to be much better. We have invested ahead of the curve when it comes to a lot of factories and the like and we are doing what it takes to kind of rationalize on the workforce front, on the footprint front and the like. There is, of course, over the last couple of years, last few years, I would say, weve been building up a culture of cost consciousness, including digital roadmap. All of this will actually come to bear fruit. And there is of course progress across various other geographies. We have Luforbec, better products in UK, Europe. We have NaMuscula. Things are looking much better in other geographies as well. So I think its a combined impact of all of this which will actually improve the profile for us. India is continuing to do strongly whilst of course in America, we just enumerated the various products that we could bring to the market and so on.

There have been a number of inefficiencies that have crept into the system of over a period of time and we are in the process of kind of ironing it out. Specifically, for example, we have this investing ahead of the curve and we are just addressing it through workforce planning. We are also looking at a footprint at some point of time, a reduction there. There are inefficiencies when it comes to, for example, on the failure to supply penalties that we spoke about in the past. So, weve addressed that significantly during the course of the CR and going forward there is certainly going to be impact on that. They always will be focusing on in fact a host of initiatives when it comes to the gross margins in terms of routes, synthesis or operational excellence and the like. Apart from that, there have been inefficiencies because of OAI status itself when it comes to employing or deploying air freighting for moving our products out, there has been a considerable increase in that over time and that we are again reducing. Apart from that, there has been of course unfortunately recalls of different kind. And we think that whilst we cant of course crystal gaze into the future and say how much it is going to be, we have been working on in fact overall reduction in terms of strategies around FTS in India, in terms of batch sizes and the like in other parts looking at other ways of actually controlling it. So, all of these measures I think total up to up a fairly decent amount which you think when we work on and actually get the full outcomes of all of this, but helping bring up the EBITDA margins and of course shoring up the overall core business of the past.",

I think one would want to really be in a position where if there is a price increase on strategic products, we are able to take advantage of that. We are able to take additional volume in the marketplace when others have issues. But those will be around strategic products, not around small products.",

Because the way I am seeing the India business is, there are certain headwinds to Lupins India business in certain in-license products.

Otherwise respiratory has been slow to grow. Were still seeing slightly lighter doctor footfall than what we would have expected. Thats what we would expect to normalize and we are still holding on. Again, all of this was expected. So, Q1 was expected the way that it is. And future quarters are expected to go back to the double-digit.

Trust you all have seen our numbers for the quarter, and Ramesh will share a deeper analysis of our performance. As you would have noted, our business has improved. Revenue growth was driven by the bounce back of our U.S. business along with continued growth in our India business, and also growth across all other geographies. On the margin front, we see the benefit of our optimization measures in addition to the revenue growth in the business. We are focused on sustaining this positive momentum for the rest of the year. I would like to share some of the business highlights with you. On the U.S. front, we have continued to evolve our business with optimization of oral solids, driving growth of complex generics, respiratory franchise, in particular and executing on our new product launches. During the quarter, our respiratory franchise contribution increased, and we executed on a couple of new product launches in particular Suprep that will help growth in Q3 and Q4. It had some contribution in Q2, but since it was launched in September, more to come in Q3 and Q4. In addition, we closed our acquisition of the Sunovion brands, Brovana and Xopenex that will enable us to enhance our respiratory position in the U.S., while contributing to revenue as well as profitability growth. As we look at the quarters ahead, we have new product launches like Spiriva, Diazepam Gel, Nascobal Nasal Spray and Darunavir, multiple products where we have exclusivity or first-to-market position that will enable us to grow our U.S. business in a profitable manner. On Spiriva, while we had hoped to get an approval by now, we are close. We have responded to all the queries the agency had raised and are working closely with the FDA to get approval by our eligible launch date. We will know more in the next few weeks, and well share what we learn with all of you. In any case, we see this as a substantial contributor for fiscal year 24 and will definitely have a significant runway based on the competitive position at present. November 10, 2022 Switching to India, the largest part of our business, while our growth in the quarter and the first half has been below market, this is primarily due to the loss of Cidmus from our cardiovascular portfolio and generalisation in the gliptins. But for the diabetes portfolio, our India business grew ahead of the market. Also, the diabetes franchise, while impacted in the near term, we expect growth in the mid- to long term given the continued growth in diagnosis and increased affordability with generics coming to the market, and our own generics. In our top therapy areas, respiratory and cardiac growth was in line with the market and therapeutic areas that we are trying to build like GI and womens health were well above the market. We expect the second half of the year to be better than H1 from a growth perspective and are committed to get our India business back to double-digit growth in the quarters and years to come. All other markets continued to grow and perform as per expectations, in particular, we saw a really strong local currency growth in Mexico and strong double-digit growth across Australia, Germany, Canada and U.K., our other developed markets. On the margin front, we have seen significant efforts that we have had underway in the last 12 to 18 months’ payoff, our margins did improve, and we expect to see this benefit continue in the quarters to come despite inflationary pressures. A word on the compliance front, we have made progress this past year with the clearance of Goa and Somerset warning letters and successful inspection of Ankleshwar and Nagpur. However, the warning letter at Tarapur certainly was disappointing for us. We have clarified with the agency that it is only specific products that we have discontinued over the last couple of years from the site and we continue to manufacture a number of key products with a clear commitment to meet the FDAs concerns on nitrosamine and cross-contamination that they highlighted to us during the inspection and in the warning letter. Overall, we are moving in the right direction, as you can see from what we have delivered in the quarter and are really committed to grow both revenues and profitability in the quarters to come, while executing on our strategic plan. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Sales for Q2 FY 23 are INR 4,091 crores as compared to INR 3,604 crores in the previous quarter, a growth of about 13.5% quarter-on- quarter. Year-on year basis, it was about 2.2% as compared to Q2 FY 22 sales of INR 4,003 crores. I would just go on to the margins a bit. FY 23 Q2 gross margin was 58.1% as compared to Q1 of 55.3%. This is mainly due to one-time shelf stock adjustment in the previous quarter, and in this quarter, we also November 10, 2022 had optimization of freight costs, both mix and rate and other write-offs and better product mix as well. There was, of course, some price erosion, which was well contained though. On the employee benefit bit, Q2 FY 23 is INR 771 crores vis-a-vis INR 778 crores in the previous quarter. Manufacturing expenses, very well contained again, FY 23 was INR 1,226 crores vis-a-vis INR 1,191 crores in line with the sales development itself. EBITDA, operating EBITDA, excluding FX and other income, is 10.6% in Q2 FY 23. Quarter-on-quarter growth in EBITDA is about 610 basis points, which is led by expansion of gross margins over Q1 and higher sales growth, which is again reported across various regions. R&D is flat as compared to Q2 FY 22 at 8.3%. ETR, normalized ETR is expected to be between 31% and 34% as few subsidiaries like LI, LOI, Digital and Healthcare continue to make losses. Operating working capital days improved to about 140 days in Q2, visa-vis 147 days in Q1 of FY 23, a reduction in inventory despite delivering higher sales. And with this, may I open the floor for discussions.",

I mean, you can look at the IMS dollars of both products as well as the authorized generic, so its substantial from IMS dollars. But needless to say, the products have been accretive, will be accretive in the current fiscal year and provide synergies both in Brovana as well as obviously, incremental revenues and profitability of the residual brand.

Obviously, the high investment areas are areas like inhalation, injectables, then some biosimilars, and obviously a steady portfolio of the oral solids, ophthalmic kind of products as well. Over the period of the last few years, weve obviously changed from focusing primarily on oral solids to these differentiated dosage forms and our intention would be to continue that. I think the budget is pretty well set as youve seen, I think last couple of years we basically stayed at this kind of number, including the number that we reported this quarter as well. We feel that this is a really good number for us to be able to work with.",

So I mean, the IMS revenues are still $1 billion or close to $1 billion product, its a material product where we expect to be a sole generic with maybe an authorized generic in the near term future. Well see what happens when the product goes generic.

We have 5 development assets pretty much all in the oncology space. Those are the ones that were taking ahead. And in the meanwhile, weve scaled down the NCE team.

      "content": "Sure. Just 1 more question on the, lets say, the India business, which has been kind of, lets say, sub-par in terms of growth. That is one. And the other emerging market and ROW market in the Europe and all those are kind of doing relatively better in terms of growth. So on this market, how do you see that, okay, when you are expecting there is a profitable progress for your company as a whole, the role of these market and your aspirations in these markets and your strategy. So, in what manner these markets are going to contribute to your profit and progress of Lupin? Vinita D. Gupta: So, I think we talked a little bit about it. But when you look at other emerging markets, its roughly 11% of our revenues. You look at the other developed markets, roughly 10% of our revenues, both growing extremely well. The emerging markets, whether its Latin America, South Africa, Philippines, grew double-digit and its a profitable business at an EBITDA margin well above the company average, and we continue to drive growth in the emerging markets, look at opportunities opportunistically again, look at what we can help grow them faster. But are looking to find ways and means of growing their emerging markets, other emerging markets of the entire pie. Likewise, the developed markets are roughly 10% of our revenues, and thats Canada, Australia and Europe. Out of which Australia is the largest now. I mean done extremely well. I think that region probably was the fastest growth part of our business in this first quarter. And one, because we had the integration of Southern Cross in Australia. Two, we had products like Fostair growing the U.K. business and the like. And our Canadian German business also performed pretty well. I mean, the developed markets, I think, really have really good growth drivers that have a synergy with our U.S. market. So, when you look at the inhalation pipeline, when you look at the complex injectables pipeline, when you look at our biosimilars pipeline, theres significant potential in all developed markets. So, our inhalation plans are global, especially for the developed markets, its material opportunity. Likewise, the injectables and biosimilars. So, we expect the other developed markets to grow very nicely in the years to come as we evolve our pipeline and bring these complex platforms effectively to market.",

But I would expect that we will start filing the DPI and SMI products in the next, I think youd see 1 filing in the next year and then a couple more the year after. We also have a few MDI products that we are pursuing. And you will see those also will be filed in the next couple of years.

Some of these have actually started flowing into the various lines, and there will be more to come in the days to come as well for sure. And there have been some offsets.

There has been shifts from potentially from some other lines, that doesnt actually kind of reveal what kind of savings that we have been able to bring about.

      "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, friends. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q3 earnings call. I have with me our Managing Director, Nilesh as well as our CFO, Ramesh. As you would have noted, we have continued to build on our momentum in Q3, both on revenues and in particular, on margins. Im very pleased that in Q3, our US business performed well, India business growth improved, and API business rebounded as well. On the margin front, we saw the benefit of NPLs in the US, seasonal product upside as well, and continued savings from our optimization measures. We are focused on sustaining this positive momentum, in particular as material new product launches start and our recent investment in our sales force expansion in India starts yielding results. I will let Ramesh talk through the performance in deeper detail. I would like to share some of the business highlights. In the US, we have continued to evolve our business with optimization of oral solids, driving growth of complex generics, respiratory franchise in particular, and executing on our new product launches. During the quarter, our in-line business was almost flat with slight decline due to exit from low-margin products, offset almost completely by seasonal products. New product launches in the year contributed well in the quarter, with Suprep ramping up, Perforomist generic successful launch and then Pennsaid authorized generic launch. Our respiratory franchise strengthened with albuterol continued strong performance, addition of Brovana and Xopenex brands as well as generics launch. As we look at the quarters ahead, we expect new product launches like gSpiriva, gDiazepam Gel, gNascobal Nasal Spray and gDarunavir, all products where we have either exclusivity or first to market position, which will drive growth of our US business in a profitable manner. On Spiriva, we continue to make progress and have received priority review from the FDA for a target action date in April, without inspection, or July, with inspection. In the meantime, we are getting ready with launch preparedness. We continue to see Tiotropium as a substantial opportunity for fiscal year 24 with a significant runway, given the competitive dynamics. Products like gDiazepam Gel and gNascobal, we now hope to see approval soon given the recent successful Somerset audit. Our US generics business has come a long way in calendar year 22, still a long way to go. However, with the February 10, 2023 new product launches coming in, continued optimization efforts, focused efforts on building a niche inhalation, as well as injectables pipeline, we are optimistic that we will grow our US business in the next couple of years. Switching to India, the largest part of our business, while our growth in the quarter and first half has been below market, this is primarily due to loss of Cidmus from a cardiovascular portfolio and genericization in the diabetes segment in the gliptins. But for the diabetes portfolio, our growth in Q3 was in line with market, with therapeutic areas like cardiac, GI, respiratory, all delivering double-digit growth. Our gynaecology and GI have actually been the fastest growth therapeutic areas for us. This quarter, we have added close to a 1,000 reps, created six new divisions to expand our reach and share of wallets. We expect the investments to get us to above market growth in the quarters ahead. We are committed to growing our India business to double- digit growth in the quarters ahead. Other than India and the US, our API business recovered with the growth in cephalosporins and other countries like UK on the back of Fostair generic and Germany due to NaMuscula grew as well quarter-over-quarter. On the margin front, we expect continued improvement in particular as we execute on new product launches and our recent investment in the sales force in India starts yielding results. Likewise, we continue to focus on cost optimization efforts. While we have been successful in optimizing our manpower costs, we have been very disciplined in getting out of low margin products that has not allowed us to optimize our idle costs. Nevertheless, we are confident with the efforts that we have underway, we should be able to move the needle on this front in the quarters to come as well. On the compliance front, we have made progress with positive outcomes on sites like Ankleshwar, Nagpur injectables and Somerset. Weve also made substantial progress on our remediation efforts in Tarapur and Mandideep. The recent approval of our injectables facility will enable us to start building our organic injectables portfolio in full earnest. Overall, we are moving in the right direction. We expect the pace to get better, as we execute on our material new product launches in the quarters ahead. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for deeper analysis of our performance.",

We launched four new February 10, 2023 products: Perforomist, Pennsaid, Rufinamide, and Paliperidone ER tablets in Q3 FY23, bringing the total NPLs to 8 for the year. NPLs contributed $20 million in Q3 revenue. India branded formulations business declined by 3.4% in Q3 versus Q2, whilst on year-on-year basis, sales grew by 2.6%. The overall market growth during Q3 was 10%, whilst Lupin grew by 7.5%. Loss of exclusivity and genericization in the anti-diabetic’s portfolio has impacted growth rate of Lupin. Inlicensed portfolio held by Lupin in the anti-diabetes is close to 55% of the portfolio for anti-diabetes portfolio. As you would know, our top three TAs are cardiovascular, diabetes, and respiratory. Apart from that, gynaecology, and GI, we are also doing very well. And they are growing, in the case of gynaecology by 19.7% and GI by 16.1%. API business sales grew by 12.7% quarter on quarter as core cephalosporins API sales recovered during the quarter. Year-on-year basis, sales growth was 9.8%. On the EMEA front, revenue growth of 11.1% year-on-year basis. strong performance of back Luforbec in UK and NaMuscula in Germany was registered. Sales for Growth Markets grew by 23.5% vis-a-vis Q3 FY22 and declined by 5.9% vis-a-vis the previous quarter. Gross margins. Q3 FY23 gross margins are 59.8% as compared to 58.1% in the previous quarter. This is mainly due to US margin improvement, better product mix and reduction in freight rates. As compared to Q3 FY23 gross margins, the slight margin is due to reduction in write-offs, freight, offsetting the impact of price erosion in the US markets, and of course, inflationary pressures on the cost front. On the employee benefit front, Q3 FY23 was INR764 crores vis-a-vis INR771 crores in the previous quarter. There is a marginal decline on quarter- on-quarter basis because of star club payments made in the last quarter. We had highlighted this in our last earnings call as well. On an ongoing basis, we expect employee cost to be in the range of 18.5% to 19% of sales, as we build our sales force in India and Vinita just spoke about that. A lot of people have been asking about our “manufacturing and other expenses” spend. There is indeed a one-time expenditure base increase by about INR40 crores which will potentially come down next quarter, but that also perhaps in some base we offset by perhaps an R&D increase next quarter. EBITDA margins: Operating EBITDA excluding FX and other income is 12.2% in Q3, a quarter-on-quarter growth by 160 basis points because of higher sales, gross margins and cost control. Normalized ETR is expected to be 35% as a few subsidiaries like LI, LOI, Digital and Healthcare continued to have losses. On the balance sheet front, there has been lot of optimization that weve been working on and working capital operating days were lower by five working days. With this may I have the pleasure of opening this floor for discussion? February 10, 2023",

So if the top line doesnt move, then potentially we still have to work on various initiatives on the cost front. And there are several things which you still can. For example, there is an element of FTS still coming in because of the fact that if there are impurities and we are not able to supply, thats actually impacting in some ways the bottom line itself. There were write-offs that we have taken during the course of this year. So those are lines that we still can work on, apart from, the footprint that we would reduce in case there is a further volume drop. So we would -- so it has to be in some ways an iterative process. We need to kind of weigh the pros and cons of potentially when would the top lines start moving and then potentially work on other items as well. Specifically when it comes to India region, yes, we are going to add more people, but were also working on productivity. So whilst there is going to be an increase in overall expenses, we also believe that there is going to be commensurate increase on the top line. So, there would be. So, at the very least, what I do expect is that, if Spiriva and other products are going to get delayed, the expense lines will certainly -- will go down that path in terms of reducing. That could of course shift the EBITDA line in some way; not to the extent that the top line can really move it, but there was certainly a perceptible increase because of the reduction on the expense front itself.",

And to that extent, perhaps theres some buckets which is not possible to kind of optimize further. But I also identified a few buckets where a great deal of optimization is still possible. This is essentially in terms of the footprint reduction in some ways. Potentially you could also look at the idle time associated with that. And third bucket potentially be on the reduction -- on the inventory write-offs that we have seen so far. So those buckets will certainly contribute in some base to further efficiencies. And that will certainly move the needle. And you are also speaking the same breadth of in fact of two-to-three-year horizon. And when we get to that point, we are talking about quite a few products coming through. Spiriva certainly, in our opinion, should certainly come through with great deal of confidence were saying this, in the first half of the current year itself. And then we are also lining up in fact for products for the future. We are working on in fact the injectables portfolio. We are working on the entire respiratory range. And there is every conceivable product which is worthwhile looking at, were looking at out there. And we are pivoting a lot more towards complex ones. So, to that extent, theres a lot more stickiness associated with that, realizations associated with that, which is perhaps not that you will see in the OSD portfolio at least in recent times. So I think, whilst, there is further optimization possible on the cost front, a lot more possibilities for the top line. And that as you know -- and EBITDA is ultimately going to be the difference between the two. And of course, R&D expense, to our mind, whilst we pivot to in fact the more complex ones, as a percentage of sales, itll certainly keep going down only. So I differ with you and I would say that EBITDA February 10, 2023 margins in the next two to three years will certainly be much higher than what is today. Clearly, its an absolute nadir from my perspective and 18% to 20% over the next two to three years is -- from my perspective is a certainty.",

In the US, during the quarter, we registered a small degrowth of 1.3% in local currency terms. On a sequential basis, the sales have come down from $177 million to $175 million. During the quarter, Albuterol sales came down marginally due to a seasonal impact. In India region, India branded formulations business declined by 3.1% in Q4 FY23 versus Q3 FY23, whilst on a year-on-year basis the sales grew by 8.9%. For full year FY23 year on year the growth was 3.3%. Overall market growth during Q4FY23 was 14.9% whilst Lupin grew by 11.3%. Lupin which has highest growth in Q4 as compared to the earlier quarters, Q1 was 1%, Q2 was 6.2% and Q3 was 7.5%. Adjusted for diabetes, we were close to market growth rates, at 15.2%. Due to loss of exclusivity and geneticization, the anti-diabetes business has impacted our growth rate as patented portfolio is a large chunk of our diabetes portfolio. We have also done well excluding the top three areas of Lupin, also in gynaecology and GI. API business sales grew by 14.6% on quarter-on-quarter basis. As core Cephalosporin API sales continued the path to recovery from higher sales in Cefaclor and 7-ACCA; On a year-on-year basis sales growth was 46.4%. EMEA sales for the region grew quarter on quarter by 19.3%, year on year the growth was 11.4%. For South Africa, quarter on quarter growth of 35.3% in local currency terms led by higher sales in various products. For UK, the year- on-year degrowth was 6% but the higher sales over the last quarter is primarily driven by Fostair. For Germany, quarter on quarter degrowth was 12%: Q3 was higher for Germany due to competition stock outs. May 10, 2023 For Growth Markets, sales grew by 4.7% quarter on quarter driven by Philippines. Traditionally, Q4 is a strong quarter for Philippines. Nearly all divisions perform well in comparison to the last year charting a growth number of 14%. For Australia, quarter and quarter and year on your growth was led by higher sales and acquired portfolio of Southern Cross. For Australia, Q3 was lower due to shipments getting deferred to Q4. For Grin, quarter on quarter degrowth was 23.6% led by stock out of certain products due to plant shutdown. For Brazil, quarter on quarter growth of 9.4% was led by the by acquired products from Paloma. On gross margins, Q4 FY23 gross margins is 59.7% as compared to Q3FY22 gross margins at 59.8%. The sales mix especially India regions played a part in the slight lowering of the gross margins. Since the beginning of this year, we spoke about optimization initiatives on various fronts. Im glad to state that we did achieve good progress on some elements of the program as in the case of sales returns, air freight and so on, both elements of which get folded into this line. Secular inflation of over 5% in input prices has however eroded into the gains which were marking visible progress here. We continue to work on write offs and other initiatives including launch of meaningful products that would further make a difference in the gross margins and hence to the bottom line. The employee benefits line in Q4FY23 is 773 crores vs 764 crores in Q3FY23 and 703 crores in Q4FY22. Quarter on quarter increases mainly due to field force expansion in in the India region, higher bonus accruals, ESOPs in US etcetera. On an ongoing basis, we expect employee cost be around 19%. Despite the lower growth on the top line, the year-on-year increase has been only 3%, reflecting the initiatives on the workforce reduction that we carried on at various functions. This also captures a negative impact of FX translation resulting from a depreciating rupee. On manufacturing other expenses, Q4FY23 is 1,303 crores vis-à-vis 1,333 crores in Q3FY23 and 1,321 crores in Q4FY22. Quarter on Quarter savings is a result of reduction in business settlements and other expenses of a one-time nature. Year on year, savings is on account of reclassification done in in travel in Q4 last year from employee benefits. Friends, whilst there are savings as a result of optimization measures, the translation impact of outside India expenses, as well as an increase in sales promotion spends in India along with and minor investments in adjacencies businesses offsets the gains made. Operating EBITDA excluding Forex and other income at 13.9% for the current quarter, reflecting an improvement of 170 basis points in comparison to the previous quarter. The improvement of EBITDA is primarily driven by optimization endeavours, lowered other expenses and PLI benefits. With May 10, 2023 launch of newer products and sharper focus on cost, we expect material continued optimization of EBITDA across quarters over the next year. R&D expenses are 7% of sales at 350 crores in the current quarter as compared to 289 crores thats 6.8% of sales in Q3FY23 and 8.9% in Q4FY22. We continue to pivot to more complex products and platforms while continued to focus on costs and outcomes. Year to date, ETR was 36.9% and for the quarter, the ETR was only 5.9%. The lower ETR in the current quarter was mainly due to higher profit in the US apart from normalization of accounting for the effective tax rate. Other operating income, Quarter on quarter, there is an increase in other operating income on account of inclusion of PLI benefits, somewhat reduced by other settlement income, other milestones and the like. Forex gains is at about 26 crores in Q4 FY23, Q3FY23 was 16.6 crores. So that I would like to open the field for discussions.",

Were seeing some normalization of growth in diabetes even and the intent would be for that to continue. Good growth in areas like gynaecology for example. So, I think the mood is extremely upbeat.

You know France is a market where we’ve had very little exposure right now in Europe. We’re really in Germany, UK directly and then France, with NaMuscla. But this small, toehold, so to say just gives us entry into the hospitals in France. And it allows us to really take our injectable pipeline that we have put in place for the US as well as other developed May 10, 2023 markets and bring it into France. The hospital segment in the France is actually pretty attractive, for the portfolio that we have invested in. So, it gives us an access point. It doesnt give us material infrastructure or a sales force. It really gives us access to the market and its a very accretive deal. Its a small asset, but accretive, which our focus has been on all our acquisitions to really buy accretive assets that dont dilute our earnings. So on the, contribution from injectables, Id say that FY25 onwards, I mean so we have been building a pipeline. We have a good number of products filed even in FY23 we filed Liraglutide, we filed Glucagon and the Caplin products were filed. So, well see six or so injectable products coming to market in FY24. There will be these smaller products, and the larger products, whether its Glucagon or Risperdal Consta, we expect in FY25. So that will be our hopefully a big ramp up year for injectables. And then we are trying to figure out ways and means that we can accelerate that with products that we can partner, products that we can acquire. The US generics team is actively working on it to figure out how we can accelerate the injectable build.",

For example, the 6th division that were going to launch is an extra urban division where we will go to doctors and geography that we dont even cover at this point of time. So I dont think it is competition with each other. Definitely when you launch products, obviously you compete against other companies, but I dont think its that and I dont think its going to have a reflection on pricing. There is an opportunity in the bigger scheme of things, I think its the GDP, the amount of spend on healthcare out of GDP, affordability, the ability for people to pay, to get diagnosed and tested, that is the bigger story in India. And I think anybody whos really focused on India is driven towards that story, certainly we are. So, I dont see this as a limiting opportunity going forward.

As far as the pricing outlook, so obviously, the WPI was 12.2 or the likes or the scheduled products. For the most part, we would have taken that increase. We typically dont take it on anti-infective, for example. And then obviously, we optimize other products and take an annual increase as well. May 10, 2023 There have been input material increases as well last year. So I think we definitely wanted to take more of the increase. Typically, I think in the non- scheduled portion, 5% - 6% is the price increase that you end up sticking to. So last year, if you take out diabetes, its a growth story. With diabetes, its actually a de-growth. So from that perspective, obviously, theres significant room to move. That diabetes part is starting to stabilize. Diabetes is about 20% of what we do in India. So, there is direct impact on the overall India number when we do it. But were starting to see all of that starting to even out. Respiratory was slow to start. But now, thats growing nicely. Cardiac is starting to get to the double- digit number as well. I think other than diabetes, everything else will be at double-digit.",

We look forward to sharing our Q1 highlights and outlook for the fiscal year. We are very pleased to start the new fiscal year strong with continued momentum across our major regions, improving compliance position, multiple new product approvals and improvement in operating margins. Our India business is firmly back to double digit growth and the US business margin has continued to improve. We expect to see material improvement in the rest of this fiscal year as we launch Tiotropium and other new products in the US as well as our sales force expansion in India starts yielding expected productivity from Q2 onwards. Our India business recorded an 11.5% growth QoQ and 10.2% growth YOY and this is after the NLEM impact as well as CIDMUS brand that we had in the base last year. Cardiology and Respiratory TA’s grew better than market growth, our Diabetes TA that has been a challenge for the last many quarters due to loss of exclusivity of key in-licensed brands is now back to growth as planned by our team. As we look at Q2 and beyond, based on the momentum we have and the enhanced productivity from the sales force expansion, we now feel confident of consistent above market growth. Switching to the US, our margins continued to improve for the fourth quarter in a row on the strength of a stable base business, continued performance of key products like Albuterol, Lisinopril and Suprep, launch of Darunavir where we had exclusivity on the 800 mg strength. In addition to revenue growth and better product mix and therefore better gross margins, we also continued to deliver on reducing SG&A as well as distribution cost. With the approvals of products like Tiotropium, Cyanocobalamin, Diazepam gel and other approvals now likely due to Pithampur Unit 2 Warning Letter clearance, we have a rich August 4, 2023 pipeline of products to drive revenue and margin growth in the US for the rest of this fiscal year and beyond. Apart from India and the US, all other regions performed well too in particular our Institutional TB and API business did extremely well during the quarter. On the R&D front, our spend increased QoQ, driven by patent litigation on key products, Ranibizumab clinical trial and long-acting Risperidone completion. On the NCE front, we were very pleased to receive the milestone from Abbvie for our program advancing into the clinic. Our pipeline is now positioned well to evolve our business into complex generics with inhalation MDI and DPI, injectables from Nagpur and partnered products, as well as complex ophthalmic products from Pithampur Unit-2. On the compliance front we have made progress with positive outcomes with Pithampur Unit-2 warning letter clearance that will enable us to launch Ophthalmic products filed from the site in particular products like Prolensa where we were first to file as well as other ophthalmic products next year. that will enable us to launch important products like PROLENSA, where we are first to file, as well as other ophthalmic products next year. Out of the five sites we had under warning letter, we have now cleared three and continue to make progress on our remediation efforts in Tarapur and Mandideep. We are committed to ensure that we will get all our sites to a consistent and sustainable level of compliance. We are excited to start fiscal year 24 on a strong note and look forward to executing on our new product launches, continued momentum in India, and operating margin improvement as we grow our business in the year. We expect fiscal year 24 to be strong with quarter-after-quarter improvement in revenues and profitability. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, welcome to a refreshing set of numbers. On the last occasion that we met, we did promise you that our results and margins would get to be better in successive quarters. We have endeavoured to live up to that guidance. August 4, 2023 Sales for Q1 FY24 came in at INR 4,742 crores as compared to INR 4,330 crores in Q4 FY23, a growth of 9.5% QoQ. On a YoY basis, the company registered a growth of 31.6% over Q1 FY23 sales of INR 3,604 crores. The sales of Q1 FY24 included $25 mn income from Abbvie for key milestone of initiation of Phase 1 clinical trials. Excluding the same our sales were 4,537 crores which represented a growth of 4.8% QOQ and 25.9% YOY. Our sales growth this quarter has been robust across all our key geographies. The US market registered a growth of 3.6% QOQ and 49% YOY (in local currency terms) whilst the India branded business registered a growth of 11.5% QOQ and 10.2% YOY. The API business registered growth of 4.5% YOY and 32.1% QOQ. During the quarter, the US business registered a growth of 3.6% (in USD terms) on QoQ basis as sales went up to $ 180.7mn from $ 174.5mn in the previous quarter. In Q1 FY’23 the sales were only $ 121.3mn. Products like Darunavir, Suprep contributed to this robust performance. We are continuing to maximizing the high value products resulting in a sustainable and profitable US business. India Branded Formulations business sales improved by 11.5% QOQ and against previous year the sales improved by 10.2%. Our growth excluding Cidmus and NLEM is a robust 13.60%. API business sales grew by 4.5% on QoQ basis due to higher 7ACCA sales as core cephalosporin API sales recovered handsomely. Similarly, on YoY basis sales growth was at 32.1% led by higher sales thanks to good demand pick up in the cephalosporin API. Q1 FY24 gross margin is at 65.4% and at 63.8% ex NCE income, as compared to Q4 FY23 gross margins of 59.6.% (a Variance of about 6.8%). The improvement in margins quarter on quarter is driven by US as well as India. In the US, we had NPL launches, better mix, higher price realization in few products and reduction in freight expenses. The margins also expanded due to higher better mix both in IRF and API apart from other reasons. We do expect this margin to sustain We have improved significantly from last year Q1, when our gross margin was 55.3% to the current levels of 63.8%. The improvement, again, was driven in US margin as Q1 margin last year in US was at all-time low. Improvement in India and API margins are also the other major contributors to the overall margin improvement year on year August 4, 2023 Q1FY24 is at INR 853 crores which translates to approximately 18.5% of adjusted sales vs INR 773 crores in Q4FY23 which translates to approximately 18% of sales. The same was INR 779 crores or 24% of sales in Q1FY23. The QoQ increase is mainly due to annual increments which were to the tune of 7.5% across the globe. Q1FY24 manufacturing and other expenses came in at INR 1,472 crores vs INR 1,303 crores in Q4FY23. These expenses were reported at INR 1,192 crores in Q1FY23. The QoQ Increase is on account of higher spends in R&D, increased consultancy charges for nitrosamine related impurities, increase in selling and promotion expenses in India due to field force expansion. Same reasons were also responsible for the year on year increase. R&D is at INR 368 crores (7.8 % of sales) in Q1 FY24 as compared to 1,280 crores in full year FY23 which was 7.9% of sales. The increase in R&D QOQ is on account of investment in newer platforms of biosimilars and injectables. Our EBITDA came in at INR 879 crores in absolute terms, representing an 18.5% margin. Excluding one-time NCE income, Forex and other income, our EBITDA margin was at 14.4% or 651 crores, reflecting an improvement of 50 bps in comparison to the previous quarter. The improvement in EBIDTA is primarily driven by higher gross margin, partially offset by higher expenditure in R&D, higher employee cost due to salary hikes and higher PLI income in base quarter. The Effective Tax Rate was 18.9% in Q1 against FY’23 ETR FY’23 of 36.9%. The lower ETR is primarily on account of US subsidiary which has seen a turnaround, offsetting the NOLs of prior year, and the ETR was also lower on part of Sikkim tax benefits. The ETR for the full year is expected to remain between 21%-22%. Operating working capital was at INR 5,195 crore as on June 30, 2023 which translates into 103 operating days. This has reduced from 119 days at March 31, 2023. Net Debt as on June 30, 2023 stands at INR 1,310 crores which has come down from 2,500 crores at the end of Q4FY23. We have done repayment of packing August 4, 2023 credit loans in India and also retired some debt in Australia. With this, we could open the floor for discussions.",

So it is certainly going to be elevated, but you would also appreciate weve been talking about, in fact, a higher quantum of investments on the sales and promotion front, especially in India, and weve added about 1,300 people in Q3, Q4 of last year. So obviously, this will also be reflected in higher expenditure, on account of that, it will then commensurate increase in terms of the sales itself. This particular quarter there has been increase in nitrosamine expense on account of nitrosamine quality assurance and the like, on account of compliance, and of course, there is an R&D spend, which is on the higher side. We expect the R&D to kind of sustain at these levels. Of course, there has been a provisioning for non-product-related litigation. Thats kind of one time. So, the parts of this, which will certainly continue into the future. But what we actually had guided for is successive increase on the EBITDA front. And thats what we would be concerned about.

And we continue to work with the FDA, to try to get clarity on our inspection outcome at our Pune site for pegfilgrastim. So, we hope to be able to get clarity on that soon. The R&D, that I had spoken about was the clinical trials spend on ranibizumab that we had incremental spend this quarter versus the previous. And we continue to pursue ranibizumab in particular for the U.S. as well as through partners into other markets as well. So thats on, as far as the biosimilars go. On the injectables front, we are actively adding to our pipeline right now with both 505 (j) as well as 505 (b) (2) opportunities. With the Nagpur approval -- FDA inspection and approval, we now expect to get multiple product approvals out of the site for the U.S. August 4, 2023 Certainly later in this fiscal year, we hope to be able to get products like Glucagon onto the market. In this last quarter, we launched Thiamine, which was out of our partnership with Caplin Point. And so we have a combination of both internal products as well as partner products that we expect to help build the injectables business, starting this year, but more so also into the next fiscal year and beyond.

And we see price erosion really at a low-single digit percentage at this point on inline products, on our base portfolio. And thats as a result of the fact that over the last couple of years, theres been so much pricing pressure, it pushed a number of companies out of markets. We got out of a number of products that we had announced last year, that didnt make sense. They were not economically viable anymore. Likewise, a number of our peers got out of products. And I think that has led to drug shortages. Right now, drug shortages is a huge concern that weve heard from folks on the hill, in the U.S., as well as from the FDA, as well as other stakeholders. So, I think the fact that it had become such a tough environment for the generic industry finally has struck home and has led to this price stabilization, which we hope will continue going forward.

So, like we said, the real pain point was the in-license portfolio, which was facing exclusivity challenges, certain products like Cidmus that went out of the portfolio as well. The core business was growing at a very healthy rate. And we always guided towards that. And you just see that reflection coming out now. I think we still have to see productivity gains from the representatives that weve added. Some of those divisions, most of those divisions have already started performing, but youll see even better results from that Q2 onwards. But I think this is just the core business kicking in. So respiratory, were growing pretty much at double the market rate. Cardiology, were growing ahead of the market. Diabetes, were growing, which we were actually de-growing before. So I think its the three core therapies which are focused on chronic, which is coming through. August 4, 2023 Were doubling down on India. So, from our perspective, the representatives have resulted in six new divisions. Theres a new extra urban division that weve launched as well. So, I think theres a lot of really good energy in India and we would certainly expect this growth rate to continue.",

The primary focus at this point of time has been decluttering, and focusing on building bigger brands. So were not -- its not that much of regional expansion at this point of time, but we certainly would hope for more going forward. We dont see a big expansion this fiscal anymore.

I have with me our MD Nilesh, our CFO Ramesh and our head of Investor Relations Ravi. We look forward to sharing our Q2 highlights and outlook for the Fiscal year. We are very pleased to build on the momentum over the last couple of quarters and deliver significant improvement in operating margins driven by growth across majority of our regions, US launch of Tiotropium and continued focus on efficiencies. Our US business delivered continued growth in revenues and margins for a 5th quarter in a row on the strength of a stable base business, launch of Tiotropium and overall strong performance on respiratory products. In the quarter, respiratory products contributed 45%+ of our revenues. We expect to sustain our business at $200mn plus level now going forward with the continued ramp up of Tiotropium and other NPLs in H2 and beyond. Our India business recorded growth inline with the market, with better than market performance in key therapeutic areas Cardiology, Respiratory, GI and Women’s health that we are building. Diabetes TA which was in a de-growth mode is back to growth, and will continue to build on it in the quarters to come. As we look at the second half, we expect that the investments we made in expanding on sales force to get to a level of productivity that will help us build on our growth rate from the first half. We already started seeing gains in the start of Q3, October has been strong and we expect to continue that in the rest of Q3 and Q4 for our India business. Apart from US and India, other regions performed well too. In particular Europe recorded strong growth due to ramp up of generic gFostair in our direct markets like UK and Germany as well as through partners in other parts of EU. November 9, 2023 On the R&D and pipeline front we have continued to build on the momentum with both material FTF and complex generics. We were very pleased to get key product approvals like generic gTolvaptan and generic gXywav in October that will drive big part of growth in next couple of years, in particular gTolvaptan. Our pipeline is now positioned well to evolve our business into complex generics with Inhalation, Injectables and complex Ophthalmic products given the Pithampur Unit 2 clearance. On the compliance front we have continued to make progress and are committed to ensure that we get all our sites to a consistent and sustainable level of compliance. With the strong focus on delivering the pipeline coupled with compliance gains, we can now see a clear path to sustainable growth over the next few years for our business. We are delighted to deliver strong performance in the first half of this fiscal year and look forward to executing on our New Product Launches, continued momentum in India & other markets with a strong focus on sustaining and improving our operating margins in the second half. With this I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

On a QoQ basis, the company reported growth of 4.2% and 8.9% after excluding NCE income, over Q1 FY24. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. North America has grown at a strong 40% YoY and 17.4% QoQ. India business has grown at 6.8% YoY whilst EMEA grew at 24% YoY. Our API business registered growth of 7% YOY. November 9, 2023 Moving on to US Business - During the quarter, the US business recorded a sales of $213 mn registering a growth of 34% YoY and 18% on QoQ basis. Just to indicate the size of the ramp up, this number was $159 mn in Q2 FY’23. This growth has been led by New Products and by also our legacy products maintaining their market share. I am happy to share that our strategy to build complex portfolio is bearing shape and today, inhalation products are more than 40% of our US sales. Coming to India, the India Region Formulations business (IRF) has grown by 6.9% YoY. Our growth excluding NLEM is 8.9% YoY. As per IQVIA, all our key segments except for anti-diabetes, have grown faster than the market in the quarter including cardiovascular space, respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI) and gynaecology. Even in the anti-diabetes space, our non inlicensed portfolio has grown at 10% vs IPM category growth of 4.9%. Currently the inlicensed portfolio constitutes around 13% of our IRF business vs 15.5% in FY23. Speaking about EMEA region, which constitutes our EU region business and South Africa business, has performed exceptionally well during the quarter with a strong growth of 24% YoY. Growth in EU has been driven by our inhalation business going strong with products like Luforbec and Beclu gaining additional share and entering newer markets. EU also saw increased tender sales. I am delighted to share that we recorded our highest ever sales in Germany during the quarter. Moving to the margins front. Coming to the profitability, Q2 FY24 gross margins are at 65.5% which has increased 170 bps from 63.8% ex NCE income in Q1 FY24 and materially from 58.1 % in Q2 last year. This improvement was driven by multiple factors which include better product mix, lower share of inlicense products, commodity deflation, increased volumes and realization of savings from few of the cost improvement initiatives like freight and other things we took on. Employee Benefits expense -Employee benefits expense at INR 861 crores, has increased 11.5% YoY in Q2 FY24 which translates to approximately 17.4% of sales as compared to 18.6% of adjusted sales (excluding NCE) in Q1. and 18.9% in Q2 last year. While there has been a reduction in percentage to sales due to our cost optimization initiatives, I would like to mention that there is an November 9, 2023 offsetting impact due to the field force expansion which we undertook last year and other new initiatives. Manufacturing & Other Expenses - Q2FY24 manufacturing and other expenses came in at INR 1,552 crores which translates to approximately 31.4% of sales as compared to 32.5% of adjusted sales (excluding NCE) in Q1 and 30% in Q2 last year. The YoY increase is on account of higher volumes, higher spends in R&D, increased consultancy charges for nitrosamine impurities, increase in selling, promotion and travelling expense in India due to field force expansion and the like. R&D is at INR 376 crores (7.6 % of sales) in Q2 FY24 as compared to INR 338 crores at 8.0% of sales in Q2FY23. The increase in R&D YoY is on account of investment in newer platforms of biosimilars, injectables and the like. For the full year, we expect R&D to be around INR 1,500 to INR 1,600 crs.",

Margins for the quarter were significantly higher at 18.7% vs 14.4% in Q1FY24 (ex NCE income) and 10.6% in Q2 last year. Moving on to ETR front, ETR was 22.9% in Q2 against Q1 FY24 of 18.9%. The ETR for the full year is expected to remain between 21%-22%. PAT - Profit after tax for the quarter is at INR 490 crores demonstrating a stellar growth of 278% YoY. Diluted EPS is at INR 10.72 per share (face value of INR 2 per share). Going on to Balance sheet - Operating working capital was at INR 5,676 crore as on Sept 30, 2023 which translates into 103 operating days. This has reduced from 119 days at end of the previous fiscal. Net Debt at the end of the quarter stands at INR 1,806 crores which reduced from INR 2,527 crores at the end of March 2023. Gross debt has reduced by INR 720 crores during this period. November 9, 2023 Friends, I would also like to report on initiatives on the ESG front. I would like to mention an important update on the ESG front. We have accelerated our ESG efforts at a significant pace over the last 2 years. We have now also received the external validation of our efforts in the form of latest assessment by the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, and it is with great pride that I announce our ESG score of 68, as of Oct 27, 2023. Our journey on S&P Global CSA (erstwhile DJSI) began with a score 17 in 2021, and last year, we marked a step forward with a score of 46. Today, we stand is 68 which places us at 95 percentile of the Global Pharma Industry. We will continue our efforts and gain ground in the years to come. With this I would like to open the floor for discussions.",

And secondly, on Spiriva itself, our initial expectation was that this product probably will see ramp-up similar to what we saw in Albuterol, but November 9, 2023 clearly it looks like, it has done better than that. So, how should we look at market share ramp-up here and any visibility on the AG launch? Vinita D. Gupta: Yes, so the ramp-up has been pretty much along the lines that we anticipated. We expected that it would start at 20%-25% level, and then as we looked at other analogs, Advair and other inhalation products, over a year or so, build up to 35%-40% level, and were seeing that right now. Our substitution rate is 25%. So, its hard to predict when AG would launch and if AG would launch, but at this point we are just working hard to keep up with the demand as well as make sure that we scale up the business effectively for the product.",

      "content": "Thanks for taking my question. Vinita, if we do think Spiriva ramps-up to 35%- 40% market share in the next year. A, would this require, in your view, more pricing action from us, to go after this market share? And second, if that is the case, should we then expect the current base that weve reported to see a step-up over the next few quarters? Because in your opening comments, I think you mentioned that well keep the base at 200 plus, but shouldnt we see a step-up from the current base if we get to the 35%-40%? Vinita D. Gupta: Yes. So, Neha we would expect pricing to be stable as we ramp-up the product. We dont see any additional entrants in the near-term. So, we dont see a reason for price not to be stable unless we see, a challenge in substitution. But like I said, substitution is along the lines of what we had anticipated. So, its been a very effective launch from our team. Id say that, in Q2, we have some effect of the pipeline fill on Spiriva that were continuing to see in Q3, but we think it might level off a little bit as, other inventory with our customers, gets into sync with the product substitution. And, therefore, we think that, certainly Tiotropium will continue to ramp-up, especially into the next year. But when we look quarter-after-quarter, we might see some impact of inventory correction over the next couple of quarters. And, as we also lose exclusivity on a couple of other products where we have exclusivity, we might see some downside. Of course, we have November 9, 2023 products that help us grow the business, which gives us confidence that both in fiscal year 25 and in particular in fiscal year 26, given the Tiotropium ramp- up plus injectables plus ophthalmic products that we have on the new product launch calendar, we should grow the business pretty well.",

But going on to on a year-on-year, yes, there has been, an increase which is close to 26%, but I would also rush to add that you should look at the level of activity, in terms of, the volumes of API and formulations that have grown significantly. Thats actually kind of reflected in the inventory build-up, and that actually translates to in slightly increased, gross margins, which in turn kind of, reverts back to a higher increase from our expense base itself. But I would also again add that, there is, of course, an element of one-time expenditure, which is also contained in here. So, our focus on driving down costs is still very much there, and we expect to kind of keep it on a leash around the levels that we just spoke about for in the quarters to come.",

And my last question is your presentation mentioned you are building up quite well on the complex project side, 40 plus injectables and then 20 plus inhalers et cetera. In next say two to three years, how many filings we can see on the complex opportunity side? Inhalers, injectables et cetera, and if you can also call out some near-term key filings which you are expecting. Vinita D. Gupta: Sure, so majority of our R&D focus has been on the complex generics, in particular inhalation and injectables, ophthalmics as well as first to files, exclusive first-to-files in particular. And we have got a good pipeline in place right now to drive the business growth towards complex generics. Already a good part of it in the U.S. is now respiratory. But as I look at the next two years with the pipeline that we have in place, on the ophthalmic front, given the Pithampur Unit 2 clearance, multiple ophthalmics, five or six products that we expect to bring to market in the second half of this fiscal year as well as into the next fiscal year. We have products like Bromday, Bromsite, Loteprednol, Prolensa, all that were expecting approval for and then launch over the next couple of years. November 9, 2023 On the injectable front, we have a good pipeline now in place, multiple products in development, a few products that we expect to launch in the current fiscal year. We think Ganirelix, Famotidine will launch this fiscal year and then next fiscal year we hope to launch Glucagon. That would be a material one for us and then depending on litigation outcome also, Liraglutide in fiscal year 26. And then lastly, I would say on the injectable front, Risperdal Consta, a long-acting Risperidone out of Nanomi should come to market by fiscal year 26. So, both opthalimics and injectables ramp-up in the second half of this year, but more so in fiscal year 25. And then, also the first-to-file oral solids like Tolvaptan in fiscal year 26. Were very pleased to get that approval in October, our goal date, As well as, products like Mirabegron and Oracea and Doxycycline. we expect both approvals as well as litigation outcome over the next couple of months that will enable us to confirm launch dates, but we expect to launch in the next, two years.",

Gupta: Weve seen some uptake in this quarter in anticipation of a flu season and the season has just started, so we just started the last couple of weeks tracking. So it has ramped up but well have to really get into the next month or two to see how strong the flu season is going to be and it certainly has ramped up but its at a level below last year right now.",

Gupta: Id say that, next year is going to be a ramp-up year for us, both with Tiotropium as well as the other product launches. And certainly, fiscal year 26 is one where we see with, on the strength of the new product launches. Tolvaptan is going to be a material one for us. Potentially Liraglutide depending on of course approval as well as litigation and the opthalmic injectible ramp- up. We expect to be at that closer to the $250 million a quarter.",

Any color on, the kind of scale up which has come through and where, where are these from profitability perspective and contribution to our overall profitability as we go forward? Vinita D. Gupta: Certainly. I mean, apart from the U.S., when we think about, apart from U.S. and India, Europe has been a very strong contributor this fiscal year so far, and we expect that to continue over the next couple of years. Likewise, Australia, Canada, all of them had a pretty strong run rate over, over the last couple of quarters driven by complex generics. I mean, if you look at Europe, Fostair generic has become our largest product there, and were continuing to ramp it up. So, respiratory has become a big part of the focus in Europe. In Canada as well, were looking forward to launching Tiotropium soon. Australia as well, we expect to launch Tiotropium soon. I believe, we are under- indexed right now in the ex-U.S. developed markets. Our complex generic portfolio inhalation, also biosimilars and injectables really will enable us to grow these markets as well.

Madam, where do you see our company in over next two, three years, as you mentioned that we are on a steady growth plan. So next target is $5 billion, maybe three to five years down the line. Second question is, when do we surpass the record profits achieved during Shri DBG’s times, we achieved record profits. So when do you see we achieve this in next two, three years? November 9, 2023 Vinita D. Gupta: Very good questions. Both the long-term prospects on the revenue front and profitability, and our goal is really to get our company back to consistent growth on revenues as well as improve our profitability, so profitable growth more than just growth. So, on the revenue front, we see, I mean, fiscal year 26 is going to be a material year for us, as I mentioned in the last couple of minutes, given the material launches, as well as ramp up of current products, continuing to solidify the gains that we have made. And then Id say in a five- year time frame, we expect the overall company business to grow substantially.",

Id say on the developed market side, U.S. as well as Europe, Canada, Australia We would see majority of our portfolio, two-thirds of it switching to complex generics based on the investment that weve made and the execution so far, inhalation, injectables, really contributing a material part of our growth over the next five years. On the profitability front, we have come a long way over the last year and a half, still a long way to go. Our highs of 20 margins certainly are aspirational for us. Right now, we can see a path over the next few years to get to a good 20% plus. Mid 20s is our goal, to really close the gap with our peers. There’s no reason why we should be below that. But as we continue to look at the company prospects beyond five years and look at investment plans in particular in areas like specialty, which long-term are our aspiration for our organization. Well have to determine what kind of investments we make. So, wed hope to get to 20% plus, then the mid-20s and then well determine whats the best way to grow our organization for the long-term.",

We want to be a leader in the areas that we have chosen, so like respiratory is one that is turning out to be one of our biggest growth drivers for the organization globally. Were already a big player in India, and we want to be, a material player ex-India as well. Its a big part of our business in the U.S., as well as a growing part in other parts of the world.

We look forward to sharing our Q3 highlights and outlook for the fiscal year. Were very pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong performance. Continuing to build on the momentum over the last many quarters, we delivered our highest quarterly sales so far, crossing the INR 5,000 crore mark. What is very heartening is that all our major regions have performed. Not only have we seen revenues grow across our key segments, but we also achieved higher profitability both at the gross and operating level. Our US business delivered a second consecutive quarter of $200 plus mn revenues and a sixth straight quarter of EBITDA improvement, which was very heartening. This has been aided by volume-led growth in our base business, augmented by contribution from seasonal products and our Respiratory portfolio including Tiotropium. As mentioned in our earlier interaction, we expect to sustain our US business at the $200 plus mn levels in the next few quarters as we get into the next year with a continued ramp- up of Tiotropium and launch of new products, including multiple ophthalmic and complex injectable range. Our India business recorded strong double-digit growth this quarter with 1.6 times IPM growth rate. Most of our therapeutic areas like Respiratory, GI, Gynaecology have outperformed IPM during the quarter. We have launched around 21 products in the year so far and per IQVIA, we are ranked number one in new product launches in India. We have a strong chronic focus as you know, with more than 60% of our sales contribution from chronic therapies. We believe that we are in a very good position now to deliver above-market growth consistently going ahead led by higher productivity from our sales force expansion, new divisions, and enhanced penetration and reach. February 8, 2023 Apart from the US and India, other regions have performed very well too. Ex- US and India, our Formulations business has grown 30% YoY during the quarter and 22% in the nine months during the fiscal led by strong growth recorded in key markets like Canada, Philippines, Australia, and South Africa and also a very strong ramp-up of generic Fostair in our direct markets UK, Germany as well as through partners in the Rest of Europe. Switching to R&D. On the pipeline front, we have continued to build momentum with both material First-to-Files and complex generics. We received 14 ANDA approvals during this quarter, including key product approvals like generic Tolvaptan and Ganirelix, which is our first peptide injectable product. We also launched Bromfenac Ophthalmic Solution, the generic version of Prolensa, thanks to our Pithampur Unit 2 facility approval. And as you know, we have six-month exclusivity on this product. Out of Somerset, we launched Diazepam Rectal Gel, which has also been an extremely nice launch for us. In terms of key filings, in the last quarter, we filed Risperdal Consta product out of Nanomi, which is a significant validation of the platform as well as strong complex injectable product filings for us. So as I mentioned before, our R&D is evolving to more complex products, especially on the inhalation and complex injectables front, which augurs well for the sustainable growth of our business going ahead. Compliance is our number one priority and we are fully committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world that we serve. We have completed remediation efforts at Tarapur and Mandideep Unit 1 and are confident that we will get these sites cleared as we have done with the others in the near future. We are delighted to have delivered on our promise of sustained and profitable growth during this year. We feel confident that our strategic focus on R&D, patient centricity on the brand front, and continued cost business optimization sets us on a path of sustainable growth going forward. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance. February 8, 2023",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, I welcome you all to our Q3FY24 Earnings Call. Im happy to report that this quarter we have delivered the highest top line number in our history, and after many quarters for the first time we have surpassed the 20% plus mark on the EBITDA front as well. Diving into the numbers. Sales for Q3FY24 came in at INR 5,080 crores as compared to INR 4,245 crores in Q3 last year, a growth of 19.7% YoY. On a QoQ basis, the company reported growth of 2.8% as compared to Q2 of FY24. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. North America has grown at a strong 24% year-on-year. India business has grown at a healthy 13.4% YoY whereas EMEA grew at 36% YoY. Our ROW grew 72% and Growth Markets grew at 13% YoY. US Business During the quarter, the US business recorded a sales of $212 mn, staying steady at Q2 levels in constant currency. This has been due to volume share increase in base products. Inhalation products this quarter is around 40% of US sales. India Branded Formulations Coming to India, the India business has grown 13.4% YoY. The prescription business has grown 12.9% YoY during the quarter and 10% during 9MFY24, handsomely outperforming the IPM growth during the period. Also, if we exclude the impact of the in-licensed products, even our diabetes portfolio has grown at 2x the TA growth during the quarter. The share of in-licensed products today has been reduced to 10.4% of our portfolio from around 15% to 16% last year, and this has a positive impact on our profitability. EMEA Our EMEA region, which constitutes our EU region and South Africa business, continues its outperformance during this quarter as well with strong growth of 36% YoY. Growth in EU has been driven by partnered business and our inhalation business going strong. Our South African business has also grown a strong 21% in local currency YoY. February 8, 2023 Other Operating Income The Other operating income has increased by 51.4% this quarter and this is essentially coming in from enhanced PLI benefits. Gross margins Coming to profitability, Q3FY24 gross margins were 66%, up from 59.8% in Q3 last year and 65.5% in Q2. This improvement was driven by multiple factors which includes product mix, lower share of in-licensed products and increased volumes. Employee Benefits Expenses Employee benefits expense at INR 890 crores, increasing by INR 125 crores as compared to Q3 last year and translating into 17.5% of sales vis-à-vis 18% last year. I would like to mention that this increase is mainly driven by the annual salary hikes and the India field force expansion which we undertook last year in Q4. Manufacturing & Other Expenses Q3FY24 manufacturing and other expenses came in at INR 1,560 crores, which translates to approximately 30.7% of sales as compared to 31.5% in Q3 last year. On an absolute basis, costs have remained flat QoQ. Whilst there has been a marginal reduction in the R&D expenses on account of phasing, the higher volume demand led to higher manufacturing costs during this quarter. R&D R&D is INR 357 crores, which is about 7% of the sales in Q3FY24 as compared to INR 290 crores at 6.8% in Q3FY23. For the full year, however, we expect it to be in the region of INR 1,500 - 1,550 crores EBITDA In the quarter, as you see, we have made improvements across all lines. Our gross margins are higher. There has been increase in the operating income and the higher sales ensured higher operating leverage as well. Subsequently, February 8, 2023 this has resulted in driving the EBITDA margins considerably higher. Excluding forex and other income, EBITDA was INR 1,022 crores, up by 98% YoY. Margins for the quarter were significantly higher at 20.1% versus 18.7% in Q2FY24, and 12.2% in Q3 last year. For the nine months period, the EBITDA margins excluding NCE income are at 17.8%. ETR And so far as the tax is concerned, our ETR was 15.8% in Q3 and 18.6% for the 9MFY24. For the full year, we expect it to be around 20%. Balance Sheet Moving on to the balance sheet. Operating working capital was at INR 5,419 crore as on 31st December which translates into 96 days of net working capital. This is reduced from 135 days as of 31st December 2022. Our net debt stands at INR 1,043 crores, which has been reduced from INR 2,527 crores at the end of March 2023, indicating reduction of INR ~1,500 crores during the 9 months period. We believe that we will be debt free by the year end. ESG Our DJSI Index scores have been reassessed pretty recently, resulting in an overall score of 69 for Lupin in the S&P ESG Assessment 2023. This increase from our initial communication underlines a continued effort to excel in sustainable performance, positioning us above the global average. Our latest Carbon Disclosure Project scores are in and they speak volumes about the progress we have made in our sustainability journey. Over the last two years, our diligent efforts and collective commitment have elevated our Climate Change disclosure from C to B in the Carbon Disclosure Project. This surpasses both the Asia regional average and the biotech pharma sector average, reflecting steady determination to mitigate climate risks and embrace sustainable practice across all our operations With this, may I open the floor for discussions?

      "content": "So we have a good number of products next year. So ten plus products, good six injectables with a couple of meaningful products like Glucagon, Fosphenytoin that we intend to launch. And then on the ophthalmic front, we have some really good launches, Prolensa, which is going to ramp up as well as we have Loteprednol and a couple of other ophthalmic products. Around four or five ophthalmic products. And then potentially a couple of oral solid upsides depending on patent litigation outcome. Mirabegron, Slynd, two material opportunities that we should get good amount of clarity about in the next couple of months. But even without that, I would say that given the Tiotropium ramp-up plus these new product launches, they will more than offset some of the erosion that were likely to see in the oral solids, including erosion in products like Suprep. So we very much expect the business to grow in the next year to maybe a single digit growth rate. And if we get some of these patent litigation products out successfully, hopefully, double-digit. And then as we look at the year next, we have significant products there with Tolvaptan as a material product launch early in fiscal year 26. The other injectable products Liraglutide as well as others that come to market. So very confident of double-digit growth into fiscal year 26. Hopefully, we can get from single-digit to double-digit also in fiscal year 25.",

Thats what I see for the foreseeable future. And its driven by our key therapy areas. Obviously, we grow faster in some. So Respiratory, for example, were growing at anywhere from 2 times to 3 times the market growth rate. But in Diabetes, where we had the in- licensed portfolio, were still growing at a single-digit kind of number, although were growing a bit ahead of the market now. But I think short answer will stay at the 20%, 30% ahead of the market growth rate. We do expect the market to stay at high-single-digits.

But I think Latin America is one where it has been lower, at least in recent times. Mexico more, because of certain issues on the factory front. And whilst Brazil, of course, has got some issues on the business front itself and we are working on that. And there, more importantly, I think one also has to recognize that we have, in fact, a host of adjacencies that we created in the recent past. If I were to knock that out today, my margin should be a good 2.7% higher. So whist I say its 20.1% and so on, you need to actually add about 2.5 percentage points for, in fact, the adjacencies to be created, which includes your digital, your diagnostics in some way, the OTC business and the like as well. And all of they actually have a pathway for, kind of not monetizing it I would say, but actually allowing them to kind of raise their own resources and spinning on their own axis. And once that happens, you would expect like those margins and the overall core margins to go up by at least 2.5%-3 % points. So thats where we are today. I think its basically a combination of, in fact, the newer businesses that we started and the conventional business still. Mexico is just a year in here and now story whilst of course Brazil is a little more medium-term. February 8, 2023",

I mean, today, Respiratory is over 25% of the companys global revenues. When you look at both the India business as well as the US, Europe, Canada, all of the different markets that we have, and we have significant capabilities there. So certainly, Respiratory is one where we believe that we have the right to play and look at opportunities to both organically as well as inorganically to build our portfolio. If you have other opportunities like Xopenex, we will certainly look at them seriously. The other area that we like, based on our foray in Europe: Neurology with NaMuscla, the orphan product that we have. In Europe, we have successfully launched it in multiple countries there. And we’ve started the study for a broader indication for the product, even though itll still be an orphan indication and looking to really expand that portfolio with other CNS neurology assets. So those two are certainly areas that we are looking at programmatically and then others opportunistically. February 8, 2023 Likewise, were looking at our therapy areas in India and the TAs where we want to build a stronger position for the future. We are strategically looking at opportunities to buy brands and portfolios.",

      "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, friends. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q4, and end of FY24 earnings call. I have with me our MD, Nilesh; our CFO, Ramesh; and our Head of Investor Relations, Ravi. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as the full-year and outlook for fiscal year 25. We are very pleased to close the year on a strong note, continuing to improve our operating margins and maintain the business momentum for the last many quarters. Revenues in the quarter have grown 13% year-over-year driven by all major regions, in particular, U.S., India, EMEA and APAC. Gross margins and operating margins improved in Q4, based on better business and product mix, in particular in the U.S. and also higher efficiencies. We were very pleased that EBITDA margins improved quarter over quarter, despite higher R&D investments and Q4 seasonality impact in U.S. and India. Our U.S. business continues strong at $200 million plus revenues, despite lower seasonal products and reduction in products like Darunavir that experienced additional competition. Our base business performed well, and new products like Tiotropium and generic Prolensa helped offset the seasonal product decline. We are at a good level with 30% substitution with Tiotropium, 10 months into the launch. We expect Tiotropium to continue to be a major growth driver in fiscal year 25. We had 6 product launches in the US during the quarter with Prolensa Ophthalmic, Ganirelix Inj and Cyanocobalamin being the meaningful ones. February 8, 2023 We expect to sustain our U.S. business at the $200 million plus level, going ahead with the continued ramp-up of Tiotropium and new product launches in fiscal year 25. We have 10 plus launches during the year. Our India business has grown 8.3% year-over-year in the quarter, and 9.6% for fiscal year 24. Within this, our India prescription business has grown 8.7% year-over-year and ex-Cidmus 9.3% year-over-year on full year basis, this was 1.2 times IPM growth. Core therapies like cardio and respiratory segments have grown well ahead of the market and we are very confident of continued 25-30% over IPM in fiscal year FY’25. We have already started to see this in April. We have also carved out our trade-generics business into a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary to enhance agility and drive focus on this high- growth segment. Apart from the U.S. and India, other regions have performed well too. EMEA and APAC recorded strong double-digit growth in the quarter, driven by Fostair generic in Europe and strong growth in markets like Australia as well as Philippines. We complemented our global respiratory portfolio by acquiring two accretive established brands from Sanofi for Europe and Canada. During the year, we also closed our Medisol transaction, the French complex injectable company, which expands our position in complex generics, in particular in Europe. On the R&D front, we have continued to pivot to more complex products, in particular inhalation and complex injectables. We spend around 50% of our R&D investments in these two platforms. Complex products today constitute around 40% of our US portfolio which we expect to increase to about 50% to 60% in the next few years. In the fiscal year 2024, more than 80% of our new product revenues in the U.S. were from non-oral solid products. This augurs well for sustainable growth of our generic business going forward. Switching to compliance, we have continued to build on our momentum with recent inspections at Aurangabad and Dabhasa with positive outcomes. We February 8, 2023 are on track with our remediation efforts at our Tarapur and Mandideep Unit 1 sites and are fully committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with best-in-class GMP standards. Reflecting on the year gone by, fiscal year 2024 has truly been an inflection point for our organization. We are very pleased to turn around our business and deliver on our promise of sustained and profitable growth, driving the shift to complex generics, getting our India business growth to 20% to 30% above market, improving our GMP compliance position and continuing to drive efficiencies. It has also been a year of growth across all our regions and business segments. As we look at FY’25 and beyond we are focused on continuing to drive margin improvement while growing and evolving our business, building on our portfolio evolution into complex generics and specialty. We are truly excited with the potential we have ahead of us. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, I welcome you all to our Q4FY24 and FY24 Annual Earnings Call. Im happy to report that this quarter, weve delivered another quarter of strong performance with EBITDA growth of 65% year-on-year and consistent 20% plus percentage EBITDA margins. As you would have seen, weve improved our EBITDA margins quarter-on- quarter by about 30 basis points, despite higher R&D costs during the quarter. In-fact, for the full year, we have handsomely outperformed the guidance we had provided to you last year, both in terms of growth and profitability. Going into the numbers, sales of Q4FY24 came in at INR 4,895 crores as compared to INR 4,330 crores in Q4 last year, a growth of 13% year-on-year. Weve registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. North America has grown at a strong 23% year-on-year. India business has grown February 8, 2023 at a healthy 8.3% year-on-year, whilst EMEA grew at 17% year-on-year. Our ROW grew 8% year-on-year and growth markets grew at 16% year-on-year. On a full-year basis, sales have come in at INR 19,656 crores, a growth of 21% year on-year and 20% year-on-year adjusting for NCE income received during Q1 ofFY24. All key segments, excluding LATAM have delivered strong growth. In particular, U.S. grew 29% in constant currency terms. Our formulation business excluding India and US has grown robust 20% YoY during this period. U.S. business During the quarter the US business recorded sales of $209 mn marginally lower than Q3 levels on constant currency basis. While pricing on base business has remained relatively flat, the decline has been due to lower volumes on seasonal products and lower sales of products like Darunavir. For the full year, the U.S. Business has recorded sales of $850 million as against $632 million last year, registering a growth of 29% year-on-year in constant currency terms. This has been led by volume growth in our base business and healthy contributions from new products. As Vinita mentioned, our strategy of focusing on complex products in our pipeline has paid handsome dividends, and more than 80% of the sales from our new products this year have come from non-oral solids. In fact, if you look at our pipeline for FY25, more than 70% of the new launches in the current year will be non-oral solid in nature. India region The India business has grown by 8.3% year-on-year in the quarter and 9.6% year-on-year in FY24. Specifically, during the year, the prescription business has grown 8.7% year-on-year and 9.3% ex-Cidmus, outperforming the IPM growth during the year. Segments like respiratory, cardiology, and oncology have outperformed IPM growth in their respective segments. The share of in-licensed products in the February 8, 2023 quarter has reduced to around 11% of our portfolio from around 15% to 16% last year, while also having a positive impact on our profitability going ahead. Weve launched 28 products in FY24 and plan to launch about 20 products in FY25. Im also happy to report that our diagnostic business is scaling up very well, with revenue growth of 160% year-on-year and around 40 labs under operation. EMEA Our EMEA region, which constitutes our EU business and the South Africa business, registered strong growth of 17% year-on-year during the quarter, and 24% year-on-year in FY24. This has been driven by steady growth in key EU markets like UK and Germany, NaMuscla, inhalation products and also partner business. Growth markets Our growth market includes the APAC and LATAM regions. The APAC markets grew by 33% year-on-year during the quarter, led by strong growth in markets like Philippines and Australia. LATAM markets however, declined by 6% year-on-year in the quarter, due to ongoing headwinds in Brazil, which were partially offset by growth in Mexico. Other operating income Other operating income at INR 66 crores has decreased by 34% year-on-year, during the quarter. This decrease is primarily on account of the phasing of PLI benefits during the year. On a full year basis, other operating income came in at INR 355 crores against INR 372 crores last year. Gross margins Coming to the profitability, Q4 FY24 gross margins were 67.8%, up from 59.6% in Q4 last year and 66% recorded in Q3FY24. Whilst we have seen improvement driven by multiple factors, which includes better product mix, lower share of in-licensed products, increased volumes, February 8, 2023 and gross margins have also benefited from higher inventory, which we are carrying on account of risk mitigation measure due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. For the full year, reported gross margins have come in at 66.2% as compared to 58.3% last year. Adjusted for NCE income, gross margins are at 65.8%. Employee benefit expenses at INR 900 crores increased marginally from INR 889 crores in Q3FY24, translating into 18.4% of sales vis-a-vis 17.5% last quarter. This change is largely attributable to higher impact of ESOPs, offset by lower seasonal domestic sales during the quarter. For the full year, employee costs have increased by INR 407 crores, mainly driven by the annual salary hikes and the India field force expansion, which we undertook last year. This translates to 17.8% of sales on a reported basis, and 18% on adjusted basis as compared to 19% of sales in FY23. Manufacturing and other expenses Q4FY24 manufacturing and other expenses came in at INR 1,490 crores, which translates to approximately 30.4% of sales as compared to 30.7% of sales in Q3 this year. The expenses are lower in spite of higher R&D, due to lower business settlement expenses, lower litigation costs, lower SG&A costs due to seasonality. Manufacturing other expenses in FY24, came in at INR 6,073 crores, an increase of INR 1,019 crores as compared to FY23. This translated to 30.9% on a reported basis and 31.2% of sales on an ex-NCE basis as compared to 31.1% last year. This has been led by primarily higher R&D outlay, higher SG&A on account of field force expansion and higher volumes from increased sales. R&D is at INR 426 crores, thats 8.7% of sales in Q4FY24, as compared to INR 305 crores at 7% of sales in Q4FY23. For the full year, R&D is INR 1,527 crores, vis-a-vis guidance of about INR 1,500 crores to INR 1,550 crores, translating to 7.8% of sales. February 8, 2023 EBITDA Excluding Forex and other income, EBITDA was at INR 997 crores, up 65% year-on-year. Margins for the quarter were higher at 20.4%, vis-a-vis 20.1% in Q3FY 24 and 13.9% in Q4 last year. For the FY24 period, reported EBITDA margins at 19.3% and excluding NCE income at 18.5%. Depreciation & Amortization Depreciation and amortization at INR 457 crores as compared to INR 264 crores last year. This recognizes impairment of INR 201 crores relating to the intangible assets, which are essentially discontinued ANDAs, and certain tangible assets. ETR ETR was 26% in Q4 and 20.1% for FY24. Balance Sheet Items Operating working capital was at INR 5,691 crores as of 31 March, 24, which translates to 105 days of net working capital. While this has been a reduction as compared to the last year, its increased from the 96 days recorded last quarter, primarily on account of higher inventory that we are carrying, given the disruption and the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Net debt stands at INR 477 crores. Its reduced from INR 2,527 crores in March 23, indicating a reduction of more than INR 2,000 crores during the year. ESG On the ESG front, of course, weve done extremely well, as youll be aware, and we have got a S&P DJSI score of 69 over 100, kind of reflecting exceptional performance, placing us at the top 95 percentile for the pharmaceutical sector as a whole. With this, we will open the floor for discussions. February 8, 2023",

First, on Mirabegron, we saw that we launched the product and then we got an injunction. How do you think is our position in the litigation, given the win in the lower court? Do you think this is still a credible launch for this year? And second, on Spiriva, we have seen some moderation in market share in the last few weeks. So, whats your sense there? Your opening comments did mention traction in the product. So, what are we expecting in terms of market share, when we need to think about Spiriva going into next year?",

So there are certain synergies, but I think other than that, obviously the bigger thing is to be a trusted provider of healthcare, which is why we have that business. On digital, I think that is much closer to our Cardiovascular/ Metabolic play. And I think its the same doctors, we are reaching the same target audience for an additional set of prescriptions. And hopefully, we will get substantial rub off benefit of that. That business is obviously, I think were talking about changing doctor-patient behaviour, and thats obviously more challenging from that perspective, but weve had some nice wins to start.",

      "content": "We certainly have seen things stabilizing. When we looked at number of the drug shortages and analysed the root cause, the largest percentage was, they were economically non-viable. So companies like us, a number of our peers had gotten out of these products, because they were just, from a pricing standpoint, had come down to a level where it didn’t make sense to continue to manufacture them. So there’s been a good amount of recognition of it, both with our customers as well as the other stakeholders, the U.S. government, the FDA, the FTC, there’s been a good level of concern across the board in the U.S. on these drug shortages and the cause for drug shortages. And, we think that’s the reason that price erosion has stabilized to some level. And, we’re going to hopefully continue to see this going forward. Structurally, I’d say that there are a lot of stakeholders in Washington D.C., that are looking hard at the reasons for these drug shortages and are working hard to see what they can do to prevent these. So, there is a good amount of scrutiny on the market dynamics that are causing companies to exit products. And hopefully, that will bring some level of balance in the marketplace or continue to maintain the balance in the marketplace, which will be promising for the U.S. generic market. On biosimilars, our focus so far has been on development and manufacturing of the products that we have chosen to get into. We have Enbrel, of course, Etanercept that we have partnered with Mylan, which is now with Biocon. We have other partners like Sandoz in Canada, and we have the right to the February 8, 2023 U.S. ourselves, which comes available in 2029. So that is kind of a partner product so far. We have Pegfilgrastim that were still waiting to get FDA approval. In fact, we just resubmitted our supplement, the CRL response. We are actually in the process of resubmitting it shortly, but believe that we are in a very good position there as well to get FDA approval. So far, weve got European, Japanese, every other regulatory authority, but not the U.S. FDA approval. Thats going to be an important one for us in fiscal year 25. And then we have other products that we have pretty far along, like Lucentis- Ranibizumab. We intend to file in fiscal year 25 to the FDA and as well as other parts of the world. So that should be a good opportunity for us on the ophthalmic front. And then we have a couple of respiratory products that were pursuing as well, Mepolizumab and Benralizumab, and tracking the markets very closely to see if we can try to get the products through some of the countries without a PD study. So, we continue to build on our biosimilar platform and strategy, but cautiously, I would say, because there are tremendous amount of hurdles as well on the biosimilars front that we have seen both from a regulatory perspective in terms of what it takes to get it through FDA and other agencies, as well as market access from a go-to-market standpoint, and then at the end of the day, the contracting strategy of the brand. So cautiously building that portfolio, which will serve us long-term as a really nice additional platform that will help us differentiate our portfolio.",

So, South Africa is in a pretty good position, both from a growth as well as EBITDA standpoint. In Latin America, both Mexico and Brazil. Mexico actually, we had a significant challenge last year with a facility being closed down for 10 months, which actually caused a lot of disruption in product supply. We were back to the market and with the ramp up of our portfolio. We have seen a really good resurgence of our business. So we expect fiscal year 25 to be really strong for us in Mexico. Brazil continues to be a bit of a challenge for us, and we are looking to find ways and means of, improving that business, but that continues to be a low margin business for us.",

So, a combination of all of that we said that will get us to the $200 plus million, and hopefully, with some litigation events like Mirabegron, we should be more than that. And then certainly going into fiscal year 26, where well have more exclusive, large exclusive products like Tolvaptan as well as our peptide injectables, we should be able to build it to a closer to $250 million per quarter level.",

We certainly have, like Ramesh mentioned, that 20-23%, mid-20%s EBITDA margin very much on our radar for the next few years, and were going to continue to work, to be able to get there while evolving our business.

      "content": "Good afternoon, friends. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q1 fiscal year 25 earnings call. I have with me our MD - Nilesh and our CFO - Ramesh. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as outlook for the year ahead. We are very pleased to start the new fiscal year on a strong note with solid double digit growth in revenues and margins both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis. EBITDA margins at 23.3% have expanded by 290 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong commercial execution on new product launches as well as in line products, continuous attention to operational improvements as well as lower than anticipated R&D spend. In parallel, we have continued to improve our position on the quality and compliance front, having received positive FDA inspection outcomes for our Aurangabad, Somerset, Nagpur and Dabhasa facilities in the last quarter. Our US business had a great start with strong growth sequentially and year- over-year driven by more stable in-line business, strong contribution from respiratory products both Tiotropium as well as Albuterol and new product launches like Mirabegron and Doxycycline that more than offset decline in products like Suprep® that have seen additional competition. As we look at the quarters ahead, with continued ramp up of the new products that we have launched, additional new product launches like Pred- Forte® that we just received with CGT, Glucagon later in the fiscal year, Liposomal Doxorubicin that were in the midst of launching at present, we expect to grow our US business at a high single-digit in fiscal year 25. Also, August 7, 2024 our US business has returned to a strong level of margins given the shift to complex generics and strong focus on driving productivity and efficiencies in the base business. Switching to India, we recorded 10.5% growth versus IPM growth of 8.7%, which was 21% ahead of the market. Cardiac, Respiratory, GI and Vitamins business in India grew well ahead of market. Our internal diabetes portfolio, non-licensed diabetes portfolio that is, grew at 2 times the category growth during the quarter, which was very heartening for us. We also successfully completed the carve out of our trade generics business in India to 100% own subsidiary with the objective of achieving agility, better focus and growth of this business going ahead. From a new product launch perspective, we have been at the forefront in terms of NPLs in India and have a healthy pipeline of around 20 products which we plan to launch in the fiscal year. We are confident that our reach through our 10,000 plus reps along with our portfolio enhancements will enable us to grow around 20% to 30% higher than the market in the year ahead as we have guided in our earlier interactions. Switching to other markets, our other developed markets grew a strong double-digit, driven by Canada due to Zaxine® - our brand business there, and new product launches like Spiriva® and Etanercept, UK due to Luforbec® and new product launches in Germany and Australia. Our other Emerging markets also grew double digits driven by Mexico, Philippines and South Africa. On the R&D front, while Q1 has been light, we expect our spent to ramp up in Q2 and Q3 with the progress that we have in our pipeline. We expect R&D to be around INR 1,800 crores for fiscal year 25, with an increasing percentage of complex generics as we have planned over the last couple of years. We look forward to a very solid fiscal year 25 ahead with the momentum we have built in all our regions, the new product pipeline engine delivering at high gear and continued focus on the fundamentals from a efficiency and compliance standpoint. Our strategic growth drivers provide us with a clear line of sight to growth beyond the current fiscal year, both in terms of top line and EBITDA going ahead. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance. August 7, 2024",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, I welcome you all to our Q1 FY25 earnings call. The highlight of this quarter has been a strong operating performance in all our key segments, both in terms of sales and profitability which have led us to report a 23% plus EBITDA margins for the quarter. Diving into the numbers, sales for Q1 FY25 came in at INR 5,513 crores as compared to INR 4,742 crores in Q1 last year, a growth of 16% year-on-year. However, if you exclude the USD 25 million of NCE income received last year in Q1, our sales have grown at 22% year-on-year during the quarter. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. North America has grown at a strong 28% year-on-year. India business has grown at a healthy 18% year-on-year, whereas EMEA grew at 26% year-on-year. Our Growth markets grew at 27% year-on-year and API business has grown 7% year-on-year. US business During the quarter, the US business recorded sales of USD 227 million, a growth of 25% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter on a constant currency basis. This growth has been led by new launches offset by single- digit price erosion in base products and additional generic competition in certain products like Suprep®. Our strategy to pivot to more complex products is paying off handsomely and we have now had eight consecutive quarters of EBITDA improvement in this business. We have clear strategy to deliver consistent growth in business going ahead. India region Coming to India, the India business has grown by almost 18% year-on year during the quarter. The prescription business has grown 10.5% year-on-year, outperforming IPM growth by around 1.2x during the quarter. Segments like Respiratory, Cardiology, GI and the Multivitamins have outperformed IPM growth in their respective segments. The share of in-licensed products in the quarter is at 14% as compared to 15% last year, which also has a positive impact on our profitability. We have launched 28 products in FY24 and plan to launch around 20 products in FY25. Other businesses August 7, 2024 Revenue in our ex-India, ex-US formulations business which includes EMEA, RoW and Growth markets have increased 22% year-on-year to INR 1,185 crores and now constitutes around 21% of our sales. EMEA Our EMEA region which constitutes the EU region and South Africa business, registered strong growth at 26% year-on-year during the quarter. This has been driven by healthy growth in key markets like the UK and Germany from Luforbec® and NaMuscla® amongst others. Growth markets Our growth markets include APAC and LATAM region and theyve grown at 27% year-on-year during the period. The APAC market grew by 26% year-on- year during the quarter led by strong growth in markets like Philippines and Australia. LATAM market grew 28% year-on-year in this quarter due to strong growth witnessed in Mexico. Profit/Loss Speaking about the P&L, other operating income is at INR 86 crores which has increased 20% year-on-year during the quarter. This increase is mainly due to higher PLI and export benefits during the quarter. Gross margins Coming to the profitability, Q1 FY25 gross margins were at 68.4%, up from 67.8% in Q4 and 63.8% ex-NCE income recorded in Q1 last year. This improvement is driven by multiple factors which includes better product mix, lower sales of in-licensed products, increased volumes, and also cost improvements and efficiencies, which we have undertaken over the last several quarters. Barring any unforeseen situations like geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the like, we feel confident of maintaining gross margins around these levels going ahead. August 7, 2024 Employee benefits Expenses came in at INR 971 crores, increasing 15% year-on-year from INR 844 crores in Q1 FY24, translating to 17.6% of sales vis-a-vis 18.6% last year. This change is largely attributable to higher costs in terms of business growth as well as increments during this period. Manufacturing and other expenses Came in at INR 1,598 crores which translates to approximately 29% of business as compared to 32.5% of sales in Q1 last year, reflecting a growth of 8.6%. The expense in absolute terms is higher due to legal and professional fees and of course, higher volumes and the like. This of course has been offset by lower R&D figures. Research & Development R&D is at INR 350 crores, 6.3% of sales in Q1 FY25 as compared to INR 426 crores which was 8.7% of sales in Q4 last year. Our full year R&D is expected to be around INR 1,800 crores. EBITDA In the quarter as you see, we have made significant improvements across all lines. Our gross margins are higher. There has been increase in operating income and the higher sales ensured higher operating leverage as well. Consequently, this has resulted in driving the EBITDA margins considerably higher. Excluding forex and other income, EBITDA was INR 1,286 crores, and increased by 50% year-on-year. If we exclude the NCE income we received in Q1 last year, EBITDA is almost double on a comparable basis. Margins for the quarter were higher at 23.3% vis-a-vis 20.4% in Q4 FY24 and 14.4% ex-NCE income which were recorded in Q1 last year. Tax August 7, 2024 So far as the tax is concerned, our ETR is 18.8% during the quarter. For the full year, we expect ETR to be around 20%. Balance Sheet On the balance sheet items, we have been focusing on operating working capital and there has been tremendous improvement there, as you can see, given the fact that the net operating working days is just about 100 days as against 105 days in the previous quarter. ESG On the ESG front, we have successfully committed and joined the Science- Based Target initiatives(SBTi) which drive our journey towards decarbonisation of our value chain. We have achieved a significant milestone from ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certification across all our Indian manufacturing sites, R&D center, corporate office, etc, acknowledging our commitment to safe and sustainable operations. Our strategic interventions across water recycling, renewable energy, adoption of human rights are progressing as per plan to deliver ambitiously on the ESG goals. With this, we open the floor for discussions.",

There have been shifts with the other players in the market, but weve seen our customer base and shares stay pretty stable until now. As we go forward, based on what happens with the launch of Amphastar, when Amphastar launches it, because I mean right now it looks like they are in a hold mode, and we would expect that Teva is going to file an injunction. So, well definitely see erosion going forward we think to some extent, but overall our share is fairly stable so far.",

And then depending on the settlements that the other generics have with the brand, but if you assume the typical brand generic settlement, one would expect additional competition to come in during the end of the 30-month stay, typically, which is really late next year, like September next year. So again, hard to predict, but it could be extended beyond six months.",

      "content": "Good evening everyone. I hope all of you had a great Diwali. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q2 fiscal year 25 earnings call. I have with me our MD, Nilesh, our CFO, Ramesh and our Head of Investor Relations, Ravi here. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as outlook for the year ahead. We are very happy to report another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, led by strong commercial execution in our key markets and also backed by new product launches. We are in particular pleased with our EBITDA performance with 510 basis points improvement year-over-year and 50 basis points improvement sequentially, despite higher investments in R&D. We feel confident of maintaining our growth momentum in the coming quarters with EBITDA margins in the 22% to 23% range for the fiscal, based on our business momentum and continued focus on driving efficiencies. Our US Business performance was strong this quarter with volume-led growth in in-line products, and strong performance in our respiratory portfolio, offsetting additional competition in products like Suprep® and Doxycycline. With the recent successful launch of Mirabegron 50 milligram, and Pred Forte® with the CGT exclusivity, we feel confident of delivering close to double-digit growth in the US this fiscal. Also we have continued to improve our profitability in the US, led by better product mix and higher efficiencies in the base business. We are very optimistic of our long-term growth strategy in the US. So far, we have evolved our business to 40% complex generics, and we have an exciting pipeline with more than 20 respiratory products, and 40 injectable products in development that we believe will enable us to continue to drive the shift to 50% plus in the next couple of years. Coming to India, we reported strong growth of 19% year-over-year led by growth in our India formulations business and additional tenders in our Global November 8, 2024 Institutional Business. Our India Formulations business recorded growth of 10.9%, 40% ahead of the market. For H1, our growth was 30% ahead of the market, so very strong momentum in India. Volume growth in the quarter was a strong 3.5%. Im happy to report that all our key therapy areas Cardiac, Respiratory, Diabetes and GI grew ahead of the market. I would like to specifically call out our Diabetes portfolio which was challenged in the past due to loss of exclusivities on brands. Our Diabetes business now, grew 19% year-over-year against the category growth of 9% in the quarter. We feel confident on continuing to deliver above market growth in our India Formulations business backed by a strong portfolio of innovative and in-licensed products, and extensive reach through our 10,000 people sales force. Our non-US developed markets grew 20% year-over-year driven by strong growth in key markets like Canada, UK and Australia. Growth was contributed by both in-line products like Zaxine® in Canada, Luforbec® our Fostair® generic in the UK, as well as new product launches. We also witnessed healthy growth in our key Emerging markets like Mexico and South Africa during the quarter. On R&D, as planned, R&D as a percentage of sales has increased to 8.2% during the quarter. We successfully completed Phase 3 for our Ranibizumab biosimilar this quarter which paves the way for us to file the product in the US and EU this year. We expect R&D to be around INR 1,800 crores for fiscal year 25 with an increasing percentage of complex generics as planned, primarily in the respiratory as well as injectables platforms. From a compliance perspective, we have submitted our responses to the recent FDA audits at our Pune Biotech and Pithampur Unit-I facilities. We would like to reiterate that we are committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with US FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world. Before I hand it over to Ramesh, I would like to say that we remain very optimistic on our growth potential both in the short and medium term. Our strategic growth levers are well defined and backed by an exciting pipeline of products in our chosen markets and key therapy areas. We are committed to driving efficiency measures while leveraging our investments across all major geographies. We are confident on building on our momentum both in terms of top-line and profitability going ahead. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, I welcome you all to our Q2 FY25 earnings call. I am happy to announce that we have delivered another quarter of consistent double digit revenue growth across most of our geographies. We have also November 8, 2024 increased our EBITDA margins despite an almost 190bps QoQ increase in our R&D spend. Diving into the numbers. Sales Sales for Q2 FY25 came in at INR 5,497 crores as compared to INR 4,939 crores in Q2 last year, a growth of 11.3% YoY. On H1 basis, sales came in at INR 11,011 crores vs INR 9,681 crores last year, growth of 13.7% YoY. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. India business has grown 19% YoY, North America has grown 6% YoY, EMEA grew 20% YoY, Growth markets grew by 12% YoY whilst API grew 10% YoY. The US Business In the quarter the US business recorded sales of USD 220 mn, a growth of 3% YoY on constant currency basis. As Vinita mentioned, volume growth in our base products, and increased sales of respiratory products were offset by increased competition in products like Suprep® and Doxycycline and low single digit price declines. We also had impact of high channel inventory for some of our new product launches which will get normalized going ahead. Based on our visibility of new product launches like Mirabegron 50mg and Pred Forte® amongst others, we are confident of meeting our guidance of close to double digit revenue growth in the US for this fiscal. We also continue to execute on our strategy to improve our profitability in this segment, with another quarter of high profitability from this business. On a long-term basis, we remain confident of consistent delivery of profitable growth through an increasing share of complex products in our portfolio. India Region Coming to India, the India business grew by 18.8% year-on-year during the quarter. With this, the prescription business has grown 10.9% year-on-year, outperforming IPM growth by 1.4x during the quarter. Even on H1 basis, the prescription business has grown at 10.8%, handsomely outperforming IPM by 1.3x. Our chronic segment has grown 13.5% year-on- year during the quarter, against an IPM growth of 9.7%. If you look at our top three segments of Cardiology, Diabetes and Respiratory, we have handsomely outperformed their individual category growths within the IPM. I would also like to mention that as per IQVIA, Lupin is ranked number three in so far as new product introductions are concerned. The share of in-licensed products is around 12% as compared to 15% last year, which also has a positive impact on our profitability going ahead. November 8, 2024 I would like to mention that in our India region, outside the India prescription business, our adjacencies and domestic part of our Global Institutional Business have also performed well in this quarter, with revenues of INR 208 crores versus INR 66 crores in Q2 last year. In so far as other businesses, revenues in our ex-India, ex-North America formulations business which includes EMEA, ROW and Growth markets have increased 10% year-on-year to INR 1,222 crores, and now constitute 22% of our sales. EMEA In so far as EMEA is concerned which constitutes our EU region and South African business, this registered strong growth of 20% year-on-year during the quarter. This has been driven by healthy growth in EU markets like UK from Luforbec® and other products. Growth Markets Our Growth markets include APAC and LATAM regions have grown 12% year- on-year during the period. The APAC market grew by 10% year-on-year during the quarter led by strong growth in markets like Australia. LATAM market grew 14% year-on-year in the quarter due to strong growth witnessed in Mexico. Profit and Loss Coming to the P&L aspects, Other operating income of INR 176 crores has increased by INR 76 crores this quarter. This mainly due to PLI and other export benefits during the quarter. Gross Margins Coming to the profitability, Q2 FY25 gross margins were 69.3% up from 68.4% in Q1, and 65.5% recorded in Q2 last year. The improvement is driven by multiple factors, which includes, product mix, tailwinds on input costs, lower share of in-licensed products, increased volumes, and various cost improvement and efficiencies which we have undertaken over the past several quarters. Barring any unforeseen circumstances in terms of our geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle East are concerned, we feel confident of maintaining a gross margin around these levels going ahead. Employee Benefit Expenses November 8, 2024 At INR 1,007 crores increased 17% year-on-year from INR 861 crores in Q2 FY24, and INR 971 crores in Q1 FY25, translating to 18.3% of sales vis-a-vis 17.4% last year and 17.6% in Q1 FY25. This change is largely attributable to higher cost, attributable to regular annual increments and business growth during the period. Manufacturing and Other Expenses Q2 FY25 manufacturing other expenses came in at INR 1,667 crores which translates to approximately 30.3% of sales as compared to 31.4% of sales in Q2 last year, and 29% of sales in Q1 FY25, reflecting a growth of 7%. The expenses are mainly higher due to higher R&D costs and some extraordinary provisioning leading to some disputes. Research and Development R&D is at INR 448 crores, which is 8.2% of sales in Q2 FY25 as compared to INR 350 crores at 6.3% of sales in Q1 FY25. Almost two-thirds of our R&D is directed towards complex portfolio. For the full year, R&D is expected to be around INR 1,800 crores. EBITDA Excluding Forex and other income, EBITDA was INR 1,308 crores vis-a-vis INR 923 crores, an increase of 42% year-on-year with margins of 23.8%, vis-a-vis 18.7% last year in the same period. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, margins have expanded by 50 basis points. This margin expansion is on the background of higher R&D spends, which have increased by 190 basis points quarter-on-quarter during this period. If you look at our EBITDA margin profile, we made improvements across all our key segments. Our gross margins are higher by almost 1% quarter-on-quarter, and there has been increase in the operating income and we benefited from cost savings all over. We also made additional provisions of INR 58 crores for an ongoing dispute. Putting this all together we believe that we should be able to deliver EBITDA margins in the range of 22% to 23% for the remaining fiscal. Tax On the tax line, our ETR is 18.7% during H1 FY25. For the full year, we expect it to be around 20% to 21%. Balance Sheet November 8, 2024 In so far as the balance sheet is concerned, operating working capital was about INR 6,562 crores as of 30th September against INR 5,691 crores in March ‘24, which translates to 107 days of net working capital against 105 days as of 31st March, and net debt is about INR 274 crores against INR 477 crores in March again. Whilst we focus on increased cash generation from our business, wed like to highlight that we continue to actively explore strategic allocation of our capital to address the long-term growth vision of the company.

For starters, the gross margins line itself, we do have firstly, alternate vendor development that we have done for key products and key materials. And the second part, in so far as for example we have air freighting which has been reduced and we are now more into the ocean freighting mode.

We know that we have still a long way to go, although we have come a long way as an organization when you look at growth trajectory as well as margin expansion. We continue to be focused on driving both, growth across our key markets not only US and India, but also the other developed markets that we can now grow with complex generic platforms or specialty, and other emerging markets based on India portfolio and in particular the GLP-1 opportunity that we see in front of us. So looking forward to a very successful rest of the fiscal year and we look forward to connecting with you again soon. Weve noted down a number of questions that you had that we had agreed to get back to you offline. So we will connect with you to respond to those. Thank you again for your time and look forward to connecting with you next quarter.",

      "content": "Good evening friends, I am very pleased to welcome you to our Q3 Financial year ’2025 earnings call. I have with me our Managing Director Nilesh, our CFO Ramesh and our head of Investor relations Ravi. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as outlook for the year ahead. We are very happy to report another quarter of strong performance across our key markets both on a sequential and YoY basis. This has been backed by continued improvement in margins and profitability. I would like to highlight that our margins are the highest we have achieved in the last 5 years, despite higher investments in R&D during the period. We feel confident of maintaining our growth momentum going ahead with margins in the range of 22%-23% in the current fiscal year. Our US business delivered strong QoQ and YoY growth this quarter with revenues at a five year high. This has been led by volume growth in inline products and contribution from new products like Mirabegron that helped us offset the anticipated competition in products like Albuterol and Suprep®. Our respiratory portfolio continued strong with higher market shares in most of the key products. We look forward to a strong close to the current fiscal year, as well as continued momentum in the year ahead. Apart from key products like Tolvaptan, we have an exciting portfolio of injectable products like Glucagon, Risperdal Consta, Liraglutide which we anticipate bringing to market next fiscal year that should help us deliver strong growth in the year . We continue to improve our profitability in the US, led by better product mix and higher efficiencies in the base business. We are very optimistic of our long term growth strategy in the US as it continues to evolve from a commoditized generic business to more complex portfolio of injectables, respiratory and biosimilars, to ultimately a portfolio of strategic specialty assets. We believe that our pipeline will enable us to continue to drive the shift to complex products to over 50% of our portfolio over the next couple of years. Coming to India, we reported growth of 11.9% YoY led by growth in India Formulations business and additional tenders in our Global Institutional business. Our India Formulation business recorded growth of 9.1% for the 9M this fiscal year against an IPM growth of 8.2%. While key therapies like Diabetes, Cardiac, GI grew ahead of the market and we also increased our chronic share, muted growth in the respiratory category affected our overall performance during the quarter. We are very pleased to strengthen our diabetes portfolio by acquiring the Huminsulin range of products from Eli Lilly February 12, 2025 and also 3 trademarks from Boehringer Ingelheim for the Indian market. We feel confident on continuing to deliver above market growth in our India Formulation business, backed by our strong portfolio of innovative medicines and in-licensed products and our extensive reach through 10,000 people sales force. Switching to R&D, our R&D as % to sales was at 7.7% during the quarter and 7.4% for the 9M. We successfully filed Ranibizumab in EU during the quarter and are looking forward to the US filing in the coming quarters. We have an exciting pipeline, with more than 20 respiratory products and 40 injectable products in development and plan to file more than 30 ANDAs in the next 2 years, of which more than 50% will be complex products. As previously guided, we expect R&D to be around INR 1,800 crores for fiscal year 25, which would mean a significant increase in our R&D spends in Q4. From a compliance perspective, we received the EIR from the USFDA for our Pithampur Unit-1 manufacturing facility with VAI classification during the quarter. So far this year, we have received EIRs for Aurangabad and Dabhasa and have successfully completed inspections at Somerset and Nagpur Injectable Facility with zero observations. We would like to reiterate that we are committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with the USFDA and other regulatory agencies around the world. Before I hand it over to Ramesh, I would like to say that we remain optimistic to grow our business in the years ahead. Our R&D capabilities and pipeline are gaining momentum, be it our investments in various respiratory platforms like Ellipta and Respimat or the focus on complex platforms in injectables like iron colloids, peptides, 505 b(2)s and long acting Injectables and also our growing portfolio of biologics. We are also creating some unique differentiators like green propellant programs for our respiratory franchise. As I have mentioned earlier, we also continue to evolve our innovation pipeline to ramp up our specialty business in the years ahead. We believe our approach on the pipeline front and our commercial strategy will drive long term sustainable growth for the company and also build long term value for our shareholders. With this I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "Friends, I welcome you all to our Q3 FY25 earnings call. This has been another quarter of consecutive double digit growth across the top and profits lines. I am particularly pleased to highlight our EBITDA margins at 24.3% during the quarter, which is the highest we have achieved in the last 5 years. Now, Diving into the numbers. February 12, 2025 Sales Sales for Q3 FY25 came in at INR 5,619 crores as compared to INR 5,080 crores in Q3 last year, a growth of 10.6% YoY. On a 9M basis sales came in at INR 16,630 crores versus INR 14,761 crores last year, a growth of 12.7% YoY. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. India business has grown by 11.9% YoY, North America has grown 12.3% YoY, EMEA grew 20.9% YoY whilst API grew 4% YoY. US Business During the quarter, the US business recorded sales of USD 235 million, a growth of 10.5% YoY and 6.8% QoQ on constant currency basis. On a 9M basis, US sales were USD 682 million, a growth of 12.5% as compared to 9M of FY24. As Vinita mentions, while we have benefited from volume growth in inline products and new product introductions, this has been offset by low single digit price declines in base products and anticipated new generic competition in products like Albuterol and Suprep®. Our respiratory portfolio continued their strong performance with high market shares in most key products like Albuterol and Arformoterol. We also continue to execute on our strategy to improve our profitability in this segment, with another quarter of strong profitability from this business. On the long term, we remain confident of consistent delivery of profitable growth through an increasing share of complex products in our portfolio. On a full year FY25 basis, we anticipate our US business to deliver double digit growth, ahead of our earlier guidance of high single digit growth in the segment. India The India business has grown by 11.9% YoY during the quarter and 16% YoY during the 9MFY25 period. Within this, the prescription business has grown 5.8% YoY during Q3FY25. On a 9MFY25 basis, the prescription business has grown at 9.1% outperforming IPM by 1.1X. Chronic share during the quarter was higher at 65% with key segments like Diabetes and Cardiology growing ahead of the IPM growth. The share of in-licensed products is around 12% similar to the 12% last year, which also positively impacts our profitability, going ahead. Other Businesses Revenues in our ex-India, ex North America Formulation businesses which include EMEA, ROW and Emerging Markets have increased 7.5% YoY to INR 1,277 crores and now constitute 23% of our sales. On a 9M basis, revenues have grown 12.6% YoY to INR 3,685 crores during the period. EMEA Our EMEA region, which constitutes our EU region business and South Africa business, registered strong growth of 20.9% YoY and 9.8% QoQ, during this quarter. This has been driven by healthy double-digit growth in EU markets like UK and Germany from products like Luforbec® and NaMuscla®. February 12, 2025 Emerging Markets Our Emerging Markets include the APAC and LATAM regions and have registered sales of INR 451 crores, a decline of 4.7% YoY. On a 9M basis, revenues grew 10.5% YoY to INR 1,456 crores. While LATAM markets like Brazil and Mexico grew in local currency terms, overall growth was impacted due to Fx in this region. Coming to P&L. Other Operating Income Other operating income at INR 149 crores has increased by INR 32 crores as compared to Q3FY24. This increase is mainly due to higher PLI and export benefits during the quarter. Gross Margins Coming to the profitability, Q3FY25 gross margins were 69.4% up from 66.0% in Q3 last year. On a 9M basis, the gross margins are at 69% versus 65.7% recorded in similar period last year, an improvement of 334 bps points. This improvement is driven by multiple factors which include better product mix, tail winds on input costs, lower share of in-licensed products, increased volumes and also various cost improvement and efficiencies which we have undertaken over the last several quarters. Employee Benefit expense Employee Benefit expense at INR 984 crores increased 10.7% YoY from INR 889 crores in Q3FY24 translating into 17.5% of sales. On a 9M basis, employee benefit expenses came in at INR 2,963 crores, an increase of 14.2% YoY translating to 17.8% as compared to 17.6% of sales in corresponding period last year. This change is largely attributed to higher costs attributable to regular annual increments and business growth during the period. Manufacturing & Other Expenses Q3FY25 came in at INR 1,696 crores, increasing 8.7% YoY from INR 1,667 crores in Q2 FY25 and INR 1,560 crores in Q3FY24 translating to 30.2% of sales versus 30.7% last year. On a 9M basis, manufacturing expenses came in at INR 4,936 crores, an increase of 7.7% YoY translating into 29.7% of sales as compared to 31.0% of sales in corresponding period last year. The expenses are higher mainly due to higher R&D costs and higher volumes in the normal course of business. R&D R&D is at INR 434 crores, 7.7% of sales as compared to INR 448 crores, 8.2 % of sales in Q2 FY25, with almost two thirds of our R&D directed towards complex portfolio. On a 9M basis, R&D is INR 1,232 crores or 7.4% of sales. For the full year, we expect R&D to be around INR 1,750-1,800 crores with a significant increase in R&D in Q4. February 12, 2025 EBITDA Excluding Forex and other income, EBITDA was INR 1,366 crores versus INR 1,022 crores last year, an increase of 33.7% YoY, with margins of 24.3% versus 20.1% last year in the same period. On a QoQ basis, margins have expanded 51bps. This margin expansion is on the backdrop of higher gross margins and lower fixed costs during the period. On a 9M basis, EBITDA was at INR 3,985 crores, up 42.1% YoY with margins of 24% as compared to 19% in the corresponding period last year. Putting all of this together, we believe that we should be able to deliver EBITDA margins in the region of 23-23.5% range in FY25. Tax As far as the ETR is concerned it was 19.1% during 9MFY25. For the full year, we expect the ETR to be around 20-21%. Balance sheet items Operating working capital was at INR 7,071 crores as on 31st December as against INR 5,691 crores of 31st March 2024 which translates to 113 days of net working capital as compared to 105 days as on 31st March 2024. Net debt was at INR 103 crores as against Rs 477 crores as on 31st March 2024. While we focus on increased cash generation from our business, we would also like to highlight that we continuously explore strategic allocation of our capital to ensure the long-term growth vision of the company. ESG In the last quarter, we strengthened our ESG efforts in both environmental and social areas through various initiatives and ensuring that our operations remain \"Water Positive\" year after year. Our focus on reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions strengthened which includes various renewable energy projects. We would like to update on ESG ratings. Lupin has received a Leadership ESG Score of “A-“ by CDP for Climate and Water. The \"A-\" rating from CDP includes Lupins performance in environmental transparency and management. The 2024 scores for Climate and Water represent an improvement from last years \"B\" rating in Climate and “C” rating in Water. Further, we have successfully launched an ESG Supplier Assessment with a third party, encompassing our critical suppliers. We conduct ongoing ESG webinars and workshops to support our key suppliers in enhancing their sustainability capacity. Lastly, our \"Lives Program\" has benefitted over 99,500 individuals till date. This program focuses on providing rural healthcare services to marginalized communities. With this, we open the floor for discussions. February 12, 2025",

      "content": "Thank you, Ravi. Well, its a real pleasure to meet all of you here today in person. I know we havent done a face-to-face meeting for a good number of years. The last time I recall we met, it was I think in 2022, when we were just coming out of COVID, had gone through a number of challenges that had impacted our performance. And from there, in 2022, with the efforts that we worked upon, I think about it, number one, execution of new product launches, in particular in the US, to turn around the US business, leveraging our complex generic portfolio to build Other Developed Markets, growing India and Other Emerging Markets on a consistent basis. At the same time, focus on cost optimization whether its footprint rationalization or broad efficiency measures, and third, our quality and compliance efforts that enabled us to work through our OAI sites, 3 sites in particular, have really enabled us to turn our business around over the last 3 years. We are very pleased that fiscal year ‘25 has been a stellar year for the organization where we have continued the momentum, the growth momentum, as well as continue to evolve our strategic growth drivers and capabilities to continue to grow in the future. So we look forward to sharing with you our performance thus far and our plans going forward. So before that, I will just start with where Lupin is today. When you look at our company globally, we are the 12th largest generic company by revenues. We had a great year with USD 2.7 billion in revenue and USD 625 million in EBITDA, delivered by a very strong group of Lupinytts. When you look at our presence across our key markets, we have a leadership position in all our key markets. Starting with the US, where we are the 3rd largest company by prescriptions dispensed. India, where we are the 8th largest, primarily organically. I mean there are companies that have done acquisitions that have gone above us but from an organic growth standpoint, we have consistently May 15, 2025 grown our India business. And other markets like Australia, where we are the 4th largest company on the generic front, and South Africa, where we are the 8th largest company on the generic front. So really a substantial position in all our critical markets, driven by a very strong pipeline of generics, branded drugs, as well as complex generics. If you look at our business globally, for this past year, its very well diversified. You look at the Developed Markets and the Emerging Markets. The US and Other Developed Markets are roughly 50%, India and Other Emerging markets are roughly 50%. And when you look at the nature of the business, the India and Emerging Market is primarily branded business. US, Other Developed Market is primarily generic business. So very well diversified business geographically. Very pleased with the progress we have made on the ESG front. So its been a stellar year for us, not only from a financial perspective, building on the growth momentum but also growing sustainably as an organization. So this is our current footprint around the world. In particular, on the manufacturing front, we have a very strong footprint that supports our generic business globally, with 15 manufacturing sites around the world, 4 in the Americas, 2 in the US in particular, that give us tremendous capability and flexibility to be able to manufacture more in the US If it made sense, based on the tariff considerations and also the economic incentives that the government puts in place, if its attractive, we will have the flexibility to manufacture more in the US Look at our R&D centres, seven R&D centres around the world, including 4 in the Americas again, 2 in the US, as well as in Mexico and Brazil, and then 1 in the Netherlands, the Nanomi long-acting injectable R&D centre in Nanomi. So tremendous capabilities on the R&D and manufacturing front to drive our growth going forward as an organization. You look at our manufacturing plants, in particular, for the US, we have 12 plants that serve the US market. Id say 11 right now because the Pune biotech facility is yet to be approved by the FDA, but have multiple manufacturing sites that are approved by the FDA, as well as other regulators that enable us to build our generic business. So if you look at our major pillars of growth, you saw our purpose statement that we take a lot of pride in. We put a lot of effort in crystallizing that statement and are very proud of catalysing treatments, both across innovative medicines as well as affordable medicines to serve the communities and the patients that we provide drugs to. When you look at our major pillars of our business, the US in particular has come a long way for the organization, evolving our portfolio from the simple products to complex generics, in particular on the inhalation front, very soon on the injectable front as well, fiscal year ‘26 is going to be a material year on the injectables front, and biosimilars, which is an opportunity that is emerging now for us. Theres been a lot of back and forth on the biosimilars front over the last couple of years, but given the change from a regulatory perspective, May 15, 2025 the FDA reducing the requirements for interchangeability studies, as well as the private label model appearing in the US, the US is emerging as an attractive biosimilars market, of course with selective portfolio choices. We also continue to operate our legacy business of oral solids, ophthalmic, dermatology, and leverage product opportunities that differentiate us, like you have seen Mirabegron, Tolvaptan that is going to be a material contributor in fiscal year ‘26. So the US is on a very strong foundation, a very strong trajectory from a growth perspective in the next couple of years. Other Developed Markets, especially Europe, Canada, Australia, leveraging our portfolio in the US, the platforms in the US, complex generics are the largest part of growth in Other Developed Markets and allow us to really build both on our capacities, manufacturing as well as R&D capabilities, to gain operating leverage across the globe. In India, we continue to focus on delivering growth above the market. The last 5 years, the last 10 years, we have consistently grown above the market. Wed like to grow 1.2, 1.3 times the market and we have done that in many years. The last couple of years, with the loss of exclusivity on-inlicensed products, the growth has been a little below that, but its still been above market growth over the last many years. Our strategy is both innovative products as well as a pipeline that we have built internally as well as licensed through partners, and acquisitions. You saw recently we acquired the insulin brand from Lilly, which enables us to really gain the end-to-end economics on the product. And we will continue to look at acquisition opportunities to bolster our portfolio in the India business. Simultaneously, we also are expanding our footprint. We have done pretty well in terms of sales force expansion over the last couple of years, and continue to focus on expanding our footprint as a business within India. Also, you have seen us getting into strategic adjacencies that enable us to go beyond the pill, beyond the prescription medicine, into diagnostics, digital, OTC products that enable us to bring a full solution to the patient as opposed to just the prescription. We are starting to see the benefits of the strategy. We are starting to see the impact of the strategy on our prescription business, and we will continue to evolve these areas to be able to both strategically contribute to our position in the marketplace as well as build value through these efforts. Other Emerging Markets, in particular South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Philippines, we have strong local businesses that are pretty self-sustaining. All of them tend to really run the business on a positive cash flow, on growing profitably, primarily through their own pipeline developed internally or in- licensed, but also, where possible, integrate with Lupins pipeline in particular in the key areas like respiratory, CNS, biologics as well. In the Emerging Markets we also have a strong position in institutional business with our TB Portfolio, which is the companys legacy business. I am very proud that we are continuing to maintain a leadership position in this segment. On the API front, we have built substantial scale, and its enabled us to really build a very strong reliability of supply on the generic side of the business. This has been a critical piece of discussion in the US conversations very May 15, 2025 recently, where the US would like to bring API manufacturing in the US if possible but we as an organization have more than 50% of our generic portfolio vertically integrated through our own APIs that enables us to really have a very strong cost position as well as reliability of supply that we have been able to leverage to ensure that we meet the market requirements on a consistent basis. We also have leveraged the API business and capabilities to build a CDMO business, as you saw. This past year, we have made significant progress there in terms of the teams and capabilities and we will continue to evolve our CDMO business based on these API capabilities to be able to build value with this vertical. So, multiple growth drivers in the organization, that give us the confidence of consistent growth going forward. So, when I look at the journey over the last 5 years, there are many areas to highlight. On the commercial front, the turnaround of the US business was a material event for us over the last couple of years that enabled us to get back to consistent growth and more importantly profitable growth for the organization, and evolve our EBITDA margins on a consistent basis over the last 10 to 12 quarters. On the complex generic front, we were the first Indian company to launch a DPI in the US We were very proud with Spiriva® to be able to get that approval in 2023 and launch it as a sole generic. We are still the only generic in the marketplace. It took us long, 5 years from filing to get FDA approval but its enabled us to build Respiratory as a major vertical for our business in the US When I look at our MDI and DPI business in the US, right now its one-third of our US portfolio from a revenue’s perspective. So a material contributor to our business in the US as well as globally and also differentiates us as an organization. In India, we have expanded our position with 11 new divisions, a field force up from, it was 5,000, I think, 5 years ago, to 10,000 plus at this point, so significant expansion that has enabled us to grow above the market growth rate in the country. If you look at our chronic share in India, so again, we are very proud of this accomplishment. Five years ago, the picture looked very different. Our chronic share was sub 60% Today, its 64% chronic, so more sustainable, more profitable business. When we compare ourselves with our peers, we are actually one of the best mix of chronic versus acute as an organization in India. We have continued to focus on commercial excellence in areas that we felt needed dedicated focus, like the trade generics business that we recently spun out into a wholly-owned subsidiary, with the idea of really focusing hard on driving that business given the growth of the trade generics business in India, and Lupin Manufacturing Solutions, which again as I mentioned in the previous slide, on the API front, allows us to leverage our capabilities on the API R&D and manufacturing to build a CDMO business. We have also had strategic acquisitions over the last 5 years. Xopenex® in the US enabled us to get into the brand side of the business. When Sunovion was looking to get out of the market, we thought it was a strategic opportunity for us to have a foot into the brand business on the respiratory front in particular. May 15, 2025 The product has grown since we acquired with very limited promotion efforts, so we are looking at how we can build further on this start. Medisol in France that enabled us to get into, we didnt have a presence in France until we acquired Medisol, which gave us a very nice injectables portfolio that enables us to build our internal pipeline on top of this to build a business in France. And Southern Cross in Australia that allowed us to almost double our business, has been a significant contributor to growth in the Australian market and has enabled us to get to that position of 4th largest generic in the Australian market. If you look at the material product launches over the last 5 years, Suprep® from Somerset, Albuterol from India, Spiriva® that I just mentioned, our first dry powder inhaler in the US, Mirabegron, material contributor in the last fiscal year and continues to be this fiscal year as well. In India, we were very pleased to launch differentiated products like Difizma and Vilfuro, unique novel respiratory products that enable us to differentiate our product offering with the pulmonologist. In Europe, Luforbec® which is a Fostair® generic has enabled us to really double our business in Europe, so significant contributor to growing our business in Europe that has done extremely well over the last 3 to 5 years. And NaMuscla®, our first orphan drug, our first brand in Europe has grown very nicely over the last 5 years as well. We are actually in the process of the second indication. We started with the NDM indication which is smaller indication. DM indication is much larger. We are going through a phase 3 study at present for the DM indication in Europe as well as the US that will enable us to maximize this brand globally. And lastly, Etanercept, which has been a material contributor to our business in Europe as well as other parts of the world, Japan, Southeast Asia, Latin America. We are very pleased with how things are evolving in the US and will determine how we commercialize this product in the US in the years ahead. 2029 is when the patent goes off in the US If you look at the impact on the financials, we have improved our gross margins from 64 %, 5 years ago to 69 %. Look at our EBITDA margins, gone from 16% to 24%. We are a zero-debt company at this point, have strong cash flows and have considerably improved our ROCE from the 10 % level to 20 %. So very pleased with the financial results of all of the efforts over the last many years. On the compliance front, we have made material strides, getting 3 of our sites, Pithampur, Goa, Somerset out of warning letters to a VAI status. I am confident if the FDA was to visit the 2 pending sites, Mandideep as well as Tarapur, our sites are ready to receive them. But we dont have any pending products from the sites, so they dont have any hurry to come in and inspect these sites. But I am confident in the near future we will get those sites cleared as well. The last couple of years, its not been quiet. We have had multiple inspections across all of our different facilities and we have sailed through each of them. So looking forward to continuing that strong trajectory going forward. You can see the impact of all of these efforts over the last 5 years. I just mentioned the financial results but as you can see from the chart, the last 3 years has May 15, 2025 been a really strong trajectory for us and has also reflected in the shareholder value that has built over the last few years. So for fiscal year ‘25, you have already seen the numbers, so I am not going to reiterate them. Its been a stellar year from a revenue growth standpoint, from a margin growth standpoint, from a net income standpoint. But we are very pleased that all our markets, all our regions, grew this past year. And the majority of them grew double-digit. If you look at India, it grew at 14%. North America grew at 16%. US per se grew at 17%. EMEA grew 22%, so a stellar year in EMEA. APAC grew 5%. LATAM grew 10% after a Mexico facility came back up last year. Its now back to the pre-closure levels. So very pleased with the growth there as well. The Rest Of World, along with our GIB business, the tuberculosis TB tender business grew 11%, and our API business grew 3%. So a stellar year for us as an organization. So I want to switch from there to a couple of the trends in our industry. As we are looking at the industry, certainly a lot happening in the US but also multiple other trends that pose both challenges as well as opportunities for us as an organization. If I look at the geopolitical situation, a lot of things happening around the globe that really put India in a very strong position, in particular as countries and regions are de-risking from China. The US in particular is very focused on de-risking from China, and India I think is very well positioned to leverage that opportunity on multiple fronts. Tariffs are certainly going to shape the trade relationships between countries. The US is every day, every week in the news about tariffs on China, tariffs on other countries, tariffs on India. We are hopeful that, based on the bilateral trade negotiation between India and the US, the importance of Indian pharma sector in the US, given 50% of the prescriptions in the US come from India, that we are going to be able to convince the stakeholders to have either zero tariff or limited tariff on drugs from India. Certainly theres been a statement from the Trump administration on that front in the last couple of weeks that sounded promising, so fingers crossed on that front. Theres a paradigm shift in the US healthcare industry with all of the changes the new administration has made, a number of areas that are impacted so far. Many healthcare programmes have been impacted. A lot of research funding has been impacted in the US DOGE has made material cuts across multiple areas. FDA has lost 20,000 people. Thankfully the reviewers are still there. I mean, they cut a lot of the policy folks but not the review branch that actively reviews and approves products. The Inflation Reduction Act, you know, the government is actively reviewing the pill penalty on IRA. As a number of you might know, the IRA allowed HHS to negotiate drug pricing for biologics 13 years after the product is approved, while on small molecules its 9 years after product is approved, which was considered really a discrimination against small molecules. And that is under active review at this point, so we expect that it could land in the same place as biologics. You have heard in the last couple of days, MFN, you know, the executive order from the Trump administration linking the pricing in the US to Most Favored Nation pricing across Developed Markets in particular. We are going to see how this evolves. I think a lot of analysts are saying this is more bark than bite. At this point, you know, a number of big pharma companies have made commitments to invest May 15, 2025 in the US and very likely will renegotiate or backtrack those commitments if the government is going to peg pricing to overseas markets. We know that the US market actually funds for majority of the innovation in our industry, so really reducing pricing in the US is going to have a significant impact on the innovation front in the pharmaceutical industry. Theres growing talk about onshoring manufacturing in the US As I mentioned, this is likely going to be very closely linked with what the administration does on the MFN front, also very closely linked to what happens on tariffs, if there are material tariffs in place and theres an economic incentive to manufacture locally that makes products more viable. Certainly there will be an opportunity to expand manufacturing in the US. Switching to India, the pharma industry in India is poised to grow, double in the next 5 years, and this is not just in India, but also exports from India outside of the country. So its expectation of the revenues of the entire industry out of India is expected to double over the next 5 years. This would be fuelled a good part by the growth in the middle class, you know, thats expected to be 170 million people by 2030 and also very pleased that the government is now supporting ‘Develop in India’ in the new R&D scheme, the research scheme, incentive scheme that the government has talked about putting in place. Just like the production link scheme, PLI scheme, that has really benefited the industry in the last 5 years, we expect that this will certainly encourage more innovation in India and was much needed for the country. The India opportunities pivoting from pharma alone to overall healthcare, we talked a little bit about this in our context and patient-centric adjacencies like diagnostics, digital health, consumer health is gaining momentum. So the full solution for patients and physicians is gaining momentum in India. On the generic side of the business for the Developed Markets, there certainly is a move towards complex generics, as well as specialty. We see multiple companies moving in that direction, both on the complex generic front as well as the 505(b)(2), as well as innovation front., On the complex generics front, we have executed in multiple areas, inhalation in particular, but also on the specialty, 505(b)(2) front we have active portfolio together, pipeline together of both transformative opportunities as well as incremental innovation that will help us differentiate our portfolio in countries like the US as well as Other Developed Markets. We have seen over the last couple of years’ blockbuster drug classes emerge like the GLP-1s, diabetes, obesity class that is set to grow to USD 100 billion over the next 5 years. So certainly a material opportunity that has emerged in the marketplace. And as some of these products go off patent, like Semaglutide in particular goes off patent in March of next year in a handful of countries, it will open the market for further expansion on this class of drugs. Likewise, theres also an emergence on the biologics front. In India in particular, we are seeing emergence of biologics in particular in areas like immunology and oncology that is set to grow very nicely. Lastly, the rising impact of AI across industries and in pharma as well. On the brand side of the industry, theres certainly a very strong focus on drug May 15, 2025 development front through AI, delivering efficiency, from a timing as well as cost perspective. On the generic side of the business as well, there are multiple areas where we have potential gains here, from an efficiency standpoint, commercial execution standpoint, operation standpoint, cost optimization as well as quality perspective - that our industry is going to leverage. So a lot going on across the globe in our industry. So that brings me to our strategic areas of focus as an organization, looking at all of these trends, the areas that we have prioritized for our organization. Number one is to sustain our growth in our 2 major regions, India as well as the US. And based on the portfolio we have, based on the investments that we plan to make, we are confident of continuing to grow in both regions in the foreseeable future. Second is expanding our inhalation business. We have established a very strong position on the respiratory front. Today, if I look at our global turnover, 25% or so is on the respiratory side. We were always very strong in India, but over the last 5 years we have built a significant presence in the US, Europe and emerging in other parts of the world like Canada, Australia on the respiratory front. So we continue to build on this pillar, as well as innovate. I mean, there is a material move in particular in countries like Europe to move towards green propellants on the metered-dose inhalers and we believe we are at the forefront with this. Our R&D teams, our manufacturing teams have looked at our evolution from a pipeline perspective on the green propellant side, both for India as well as developed markets like US, Europe and other parts of the world. Third, delivering on our new product launches “on time and on budget” is a major part of our focus. Its been a substantial success for us over the last 3 years. Our team has come a long way in ensuring that the products that we target, we deliver them in time. And thats how youve seen products like Mirabegron, products like Tolvaptan, products like Spiriva® come to market in time and theres a very strong focus in the organization to deliver our new product launches. Number four is establishing a Speciality business. I mean, a number of you know, we have had a legacy speciality business in the US. We actually started the US business on the speciality front, on the paediatrics side. Then over the years, we went into the womens health side of the business, which we had some success with and got out when we saw challenges 3-4 years ago, when we went through the downturn. We are refocusing our efforts on building the speciality side of the business, both with acquisitions as well as internal pipeline, especially the 505(b)(2) pipeline that we are developing in-house. Fifth is establishing injectables and biosimilars as a growth driver for the future. I mean, we have capabilities across both in R&D and manufacturing, as you know. And this year in particular, were going to see a material inflection on the injectables front with products like Glucagon, products like Liraglutide, Risperdal Consta® from Nanomi coming to market. And with the emerging biologics opportunities with the FDA regulations easing up, as well as the private label business emerging in the US, we expect biosimilars to be May 15, 2025 a material growth driver going forward. Of course, as barriers reduce, the competition tends to increase. So we are very selective with our portfolio here to ensure that we are either in the first wave or we are one of a few players that will enable us to get a solid return on our investment with biologics, as well as grow the business on a sustainable basis. Sixth is establishing a novel product pipeline. I mentioned the 505(b)(2) pipeline that we are developing internally on our long-acting injectable platform, on our respiratory platform, some oral solids as well, that will help us build both our speciality business and in some cases also help us build a hospital business in the US in particular. Then building scale across other developed generic markets. So we believe that the platforms that we have in place and the pipeline that we have in place whether its on the respiratory front, biologics front, or the injectables front, has tremendous opportunities outside of the US, in particular in Europe, Canada, as well as Australia-like countries and theres a tremendous opportunity for us to gain operating leverage from these platforms across the global generics market, especially in the Developed Markets. So very focused on growing our European business and Other Developed Markets at a faster pace through these strengths that we have established. And lastly, Id say that continued focus on the cost position across our network. The bulk of our business is still generics, and cost optimization has to be a consistent effort to drive profitability on the generic side of the business. Theres still tremendous opportunities. As much as we have gained a lot of efficiencies over the last 5 years, theres still a lot of opportunities that we have on the operational front, on the supply chain front, on the quality front, to be able to continue to improve our cost position as an organization. All of this is enabled by, number one, our focus in quality and compliance. We have an aspiration to be best in class in compliance. We were best in class 10 years ago, and theres no reason why we cant get to this goal in the next few years. We are exploring areas that we can leverage digital and AI to get more efficient, to get more creative as an organization. Its a big lever that is yet to unfold, yet to really conclude what areas make sense for us to double down. But we have embarked on 5 or 6 material areas where we believe we can make a material difference through AI as well as digital. And last and most importantly is our people’s strategy. I mean, all of what you have seen so far has been delivered by a very strong, committed team, and we continue to work on our team both developing our people internally as well as bringing in capabilities from the outside to compliment and drive growth going forward along with our internal team. So very strong areas of growth that we have identified for ourselves. Were very focused on each of these areas and are confident that we will continue to grow our business on a consistent basis in the years to come ahead. So with that, I will hand it over to Nilesh to walk us through a deeper review of the business.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. First of all, thank you for coming today. We used to always love doing this investor meet in person and COVID derailed it and then we did May 15, 2025 it in 2022. Then we didnt do it for a couple of years after. We certainly hope to do this regularly. We just think its a wonderful opportunity to engage with you today. Vinita talked about people. I will just quickly introduce some of our people. Ranjana, our Head of Quality. Rakesh, our CIO. Christoph, our Head of Tech Ops. Rajiv, our head of India region. Yash, our HR head. Moving to the next table, Tommaso, Vinitas Chief of Staff. Saurabh, from our India region, the power behind Rajiv. Sumita, Head of Business Development for India. Mohan, in charge of taxes. Amit, our Company Secretary. Robin, our finance team. Suresh, from our finance group. And then last of all, Ravi. Im missing out a few in the back but I think this is an opportunity for you to see some of the power behind Lupin as well. So on the business side, I think the biggest change which has happened is the US business, where we were in this slump and then we have grown the US from a net sales perspective back up to the USD 900-plus million, USD 925 million, year-on-year growth of 13%. That is obviously one of the biggest moves that we have had in the Lupin numbers. As you know, we have been number three in the US in terms of generic market share, 4.9% market share. Were very proud of the position that we have and especially at times like today when Indias role is being questioned, when tariffs are coming in question, I think a very important lever in this all is the market share that we have. We are very proud of the market share that we have in the US And you have seen this before, but in terms of the number of products, about 138 products in the market, 105 of them were in the top three, 45 were number one. We have more than a hundred products pending in the pipeline, addressing a market size of close to USD 150 billion. And you know the recent NPLs, Mirabegron, Spiriva®, Pred Forte®, and of course earlier this week, Tolvaptan. So obviously on a very, very good trot from a launch perspective. As Vinita mentioned, the focus is on cost efficiency and optimization. And then obviously we want to build on that base business that we have of specialty. We have Xopenex® and NaMuscla® that we have but you know, this was legacy for us. We started with Suprep® in the US So we certainly want to build out that specialty. But if you really see what thats done, I mean, if you look at the journey in the last five years, , USD 800 million went to USD 720 million, USD 738 million, USD 632 million. I mean, that obviously was a very disruptive time for Lupins P&L. And if you see the last three years, you see that consistent 21% growth in the business. Were very proud of the way that we have turned this around. And obviously our collective goal is to sustain this growth that we have had and build on this business. Obviously, thats come from the move to complex generics. So if you see in FY25, complex generics is about 30% of our revenues. If you look at the next five years, that complex generics will move to 49% of revenues. And then obviously the key growth drivers for the generics business remains NPLs, more than 100 plus NPLs. And 65% of revenues that we will get will come from complex generics. Over 60 filings in the next five years, focused highly on First to File, on Para 4 products. And then clearly in the US, the key imperative would, other than the move getting deeper into complex generics, would be to build on specialty, both through our own portfolio but through acquisitions and alliances as well. May 15, 2025 On our second key market, India, were ranked number eight. Were not happy at all with this rank. I think we have to be in the top five but currently number eight. Good growth rate in the last 10 years, 12%, 1.2 times the market growth rate, 3.4% market share, our key therapy areas, as you know, are Diabetes, Cardiovascular and Respiratory. GI is actually the fourth largest therapy area for us. Doing well in Diabetes and Cardio. Respiratory has been extremely sluggish in the last two years. I think this will be the year that it will bounce back as well. GI, again, growing very strong, double digit. Vinita mentioned the sales force size, but total more than 10,000 people across the sales team. Clearly, our focus is on building the innovation pipeline for India and part of that is going to come from very strong in-licensing as well. So if you see the India business and just double-clicking on that a little bit, if you split it between the IL, the in-license and the non-IL, you will see that the in-license portfolio actually helped us grow in the past., Even in 2021-22, you see the growth coming from the darker green bar, which is in-license portfolio. The last three years, that portfolio has been challenged. De-growth in FY23 of 13% in that portfolio, minus 1% and minus 12% in FY24 & FY25 respectively and despite that minus 12% growth, we have grown at 8.4%, versus the market growth of 8% in FY25. The loss of exclusivity, the erosion on the in-license part has largely played out and therefore from FY26, we see getting back on the double-digit growth across the portfolio and continuing double-digit growth going forward. The focus, as Vinita mentioned, is on chronic. If you look at the current portfolio, 64% of sales come from chronic. If you see by FY30, itll actually move to 70%, 69% - 70%. So we actually will get even deeper onto the chronic side. Number two in Respiratory, number three in Diabetes, number three in Cardiac as well. The growth going forward, first of all, the aspiration is to grow at 1.2 to 1.3 times the market. Part of that is its going to come from enhanced reach, over 2,000 representatives to be added in the next four, five years. Basically programmatically, we want to add the 400-500 representatives every year. A scientific approach, when were reaching out to doctors and the community including the patients that we would work with as well. NPLs, new product launches, is going to be a key growth driver, over 80 products in our portfolio for the next five years. Focus will remain on chronic therapy areas. Obviously, as a large cardiac and diabetes player, GLP-1s is going to be an important part of that play. But also beyond that, getting deeper into GI, building that as the fourth large therapy area for us, getting into oncology, we are there but we are fledgling in our presence. So oncology, CNS, Vitamins, scaling up in these areas as well, as the next three areas that will come into our India region. Obviously, partnering as the market is changing with e-commerce, with organized retail, with the institutional business as well. We have evolved organization structure to meet with that. . Before that, the extra urban. This is a part of the market that we feel is very exciting. I think really going into tier two, tier three, we started with the pilot. The pilot was successful. We are now scaling up, and thats where the major addition in sales force is happening this year. Obviously, we would look at May 15, 2025 opportunities in India. There are few and far between but we want to be there. We have acquired a few, but not of scale. I think that is certainly an organization priority and then moving closer to physicians, closer to patients through our adjacencies as well. Other Developed Markets, I think Europe is, you know, we have always talked about the fact that we built India and the US and in that neglected Europe, we are certainly focused on Europe at this point of time. Its grown to a reasonable scale, USD 195 million in the last fiscal, 14% growth rate in the last five years. Obviously, products like NaMuscla®, the respiratory portfolio is driving the business in the Europe including Etanercept Biosimilar. We are in a few regions and the others are through Pan-European partnerships. So nice reach across Europe but to be scaled. If you look at the next five years, 50 plus NPLs in Europe, 55% of revenues will actually come from complex generics and obviously expand into other markets with our own onshore presence within Europe. Canada, again, a nice little business, USD 47 million sales, FY25, 18% CAGR for the last five years and 60% of the business coming from specialty. And if you look again, going forward, complex generics will drive that portfolio, a lot of it led by inhalation. And lastly, on the Other Developed Markets, Australia, USD 78 million sales. Were ranked number four in the Australian generic market, 20% CAGR in the last five years, growth led by both our own business but our partnered business within Australia as well. The focus is on new product launches there, including biosimilars and were expanding into the New Zealand market as well. To the next bucket, Other Emerging Markets, South Africa, USD 83 million, number one rank in cardiovascular, the eight largest generic company in South Africa. Focus again, remains new product launches. There as a large cardiac player to move into GLP-1s as well, participating in ARV tenders as well. Philippines, close to USD 40 million in sales. We are number two ranked in our reference market in that, again, a very wide portfolio of products. Youll see GLP-1s everywhere but 50-plus launches including biosimilars planned for the Philippines. Mexico, about USD 50 million. Net sales, we are number three, ranked as an ophthalmic player. 70% of our revenues come from ophthalmics and more than 20 products lined up for launch including NaMuscla®. Brazil, USD 42 million, number three rank in their reference market. 40% of our portfolio in Brazil is OTC. Were looking at point-of-sales expansion and we are looking at new product launches across multiple therapy areas in Brazil. May 15, 2025 Lastly, our GIB business actually had one of the best CAGR’s across our businesses, 20% in the last five years. Growth obviously led by scaling up TB, including prevention of tuberculosis with products like Rifapentine and building out the HIV portfolio as well. So the adjacencies, really quickly, we dont talk that much about those. On Lupin Diagnostics, 44% year-on-year revenue growth. We have been amongst our peers fastest to get to INR 100 crores. All our labs are approved by NABL, and that was a key part because we want to be a trusted partner on the diagnostic side. That is our differentiation in this area. The target is to be EBITDA positive in FY27. Pretty good reach across most cities. Were not in North India. Other than that, were actually across most geographies in India. Lupin Life is our OTC business, INR 150 crores, big plans to grow. The aspiration is to well more than double this in the next three to four years. A lot of reach being expanded at this point of time. We have two anchor products. There are two more products that were launching as well. So small business today but certainly another anchor to growth in India. Our digital health, we have talked about this a little bit but this has been a challenging part of the business for us because youre actually changing physician and patient behaviour. So its been slow. I think its getting to that inflection point at this point. The goal there is to be the partner of choice for post-discharge care of cardiac patients. We have our first product. Theres a follow-on product. The focus here is connected devices, AI-powered apps, experienced healthcare professionals backing it up. If somebody has a cardiac event, we want to be the partner of choice post-discharge. Lupin Life Sciences is our trade generics business. We launched this last year, obviously building on the equity of the Lupin brand and quality products from Lupin. The focus is primarily on tier two and tier three towns and areas where were currently under-prescribed and we are building a lot of on-the-ground presence with more than 400 people in that field force, which is different from the model which many other people do it. The idea there is really to emerge as a strong player in this space. And the last of the adjacencies, Lupin Manufacturing Solutions, our CDMO business. We have a full Global team, all the structures in place. I think we have taken a lot of effort to put the team together in the course of the last year. We have this legacy of developing complex products including fermentation products. And we have large-scale manufacturing from a CGMP perspective as well. And we have an R&D center in Pune. That really positions us to be able to work on innovation pipeline but also to carve out our own differentiation within the space. And part of that is going to be in areas like peptides or in ADCs. On the R&D and the portfolio, its been over 20 years. And we started with the First to Files. Right now, were pursuing 30-plus First to Files, as I mentioned. Then we moved into inhalation. We really have that franchise across the inhalation space. So MDIs, DPIs, SMIs even. So obviously getting May 15, 2025 deep into inhalation across the US, India, across Europe as well, to expand to other geographies as well. Building that presence next on injectables, on the complex injectables in particular, depo injections, peptides, liposomal products as well. We will talk a little bit more of our pipeline in the next few slides. Biosimilars, where we built a nice commercial presence ex-US but the intention of course is to be meaningful in the US on that as well. And what we have is absolutely world- class R&D and manufacturing capabilities and the ability to do a pretty wide array of products. And the last on the product development and capability building is obviously Specialty. Building out the 505(B)(2), building out the value-added medicines, whether its long-acting injectables, oral solids, IUDs implants, green propellants as well. So you see a wide array of capabilities that we’ve built over the years. And what its really done is deliver on the business. So if you see the US, FY20 complex generics was 2% of the business, grew to 34% in FY25. And if you see again the next five years, will grow to 55% of the business in the US. In Europe, , 9% was the composition of complex platforms in FY20, 55% at this point of time and growing to two-thirds of the business by FY30. I wont talk through the entire portfolio that has driven this but obviously we have had some nice launches. We had Etanercept. We obviously had Albuterol in the US in 2020. Luforbec® that we launched in Europe became a big anchor product. Then obviously came products like Tiotropium and theres a whole slew of products, especially on the inhalation side, which have helped deliver this. If you look at the upcoming launches and we were cognizant that we have obviously had a good last year. We have a good FY26 as well. Whats happening in FY27? Its actually a good portfolio coming in FY27 as well. Three products that we intend to launch on the inhalation side, a couple of products on the injectable side, biosimilars, two products that will come to market and a couple of important oral solids that will come out as well and our first specialty product in FY27. Before that in FY26, you see injectables picking up. You see Glucagon, you see Liraglutide, you see Risperidone long-acting, that we hope to launch this year. Etanercept in Australia, obviously Tolvaptan, which we have launched and another oral solution, that we will launch, which will be a key product as well. This is on the back of good number of products in the market. So again, , in inhalation, 12 products in the market across geographies, injectable, over 10 products, biosimilars, obviously Etanercept only at this point of time and the oral solids, obviously well over 300 products over time. And you see the products in the pipeline, and inhalation, thats where we are all in, 30 products in the pipeline. Injectable, another 30 products that are in that pipeline as well. Biosimilars, we have over 10 products in the pipeline. And obviously all the other dosage forms kind of adds up in the number as well. If you look further, if you look at FY28, you see more of that inhalation, you see injectables, you see the biosimilars coming to market as well. And in FY29, you see a whole slew of inhalation products that will come to market and thats I think, when we will get steady on the injectable side as well. So we May 15, 2025 can talk more about this but if you see the pie chart at the bottom, I think those are the revenues of new product launches that will come from Complex Generics. So if you see FY26, obviously products like Tolvaptan are contributing significantly to the new product revenues. But FY27, you see a very large portion, 55% coming from Complex Generics. Similar in FY28, 54%, even higher. FY29, 61% coming from Complex Generics and even higher thereafter with 62% revenues coming from Complex Generics in FY30. Quickly on quality, you know, we have color-coded this a little differently because we wanted to add the biotech facility which is pending. Like we said, we have got two sites which have been in a non-satisfactory state of compliance. Obviously biotech, were pending approval from the US as well. So we have put that into the list. Other than that, obviously the rest of the facilities have been inspected regularly and have good standing. As you would see over the years, I think FY20 was obviously the worst where we had five sites which were not in a satisfactory state of compliance. Now down to two. We have had a bunch of inspections. EIR’s from about five sites that have been received in the last year. Our goal is, one, to be best in class. Two, to target all sites to be ready at any point of time for an inspection. Were looking at really the supply chain. So its not just us. What happens before us with KSM’s or API’s that we would buy? So thats part of the ensuring quality. And the other part is on training. Can we really use training as a differentiator? Focusing a lot more on training than what we did in the past. And lastly, you know, we talked about Christoph. We have set this Global Tech Ops function. Very good results over the last few years on this. If you look at from a customer focus perspective, our OTIF levels are at 100%.. Even for India, 98%. Lowest ever backorder, lowest ever FTS. And our focus is on de- risking. Whether its from China or whether its other single source entities, we are working to build agility into the system so that our lead times just keep getting better and better. Thats our focus. I think theres a lot more that we would want to do on that customer focus path. On the cost leadership, we have talked in the past. USD 50 million were delivered last year through AVDs, through freight optimization, yield improvement and the like. Were optimizing our global footprint. Our air ocean ratio is down to an all-time low. Basically, its only new product launches that we would send by air. Everything else pretty much goes by ocean. Again, the supply chain is really, really working, including our manufacturing, procurement and the like. And the next anchor on this is technology leadership, whether it is AI or digital transformation. We have Kinaxis, which enables the entire organization globally. We have several of our sites which are fully paperless. And on the backbone of that, you can imagine what you can do with AI today. And now were investing a lot more into automation and the like, continuous flow reactors. We started with one or two use cases. Now theres three or four cases that we are considering. Robotics that were introducing into some of our plants as well. So very exciting time from a manufacturing perspective. I will hand over to Ramesh now. May 15, 2025",

      "content": "Thank you, Nilesh. So friends, we are meeting after a gap of nearly three years. Obviously, this used to be an annual event. And we were very happy to meet everybody. But unfortunately, COVID actually put rest to that for some time. But glad to be back in action in that sense. But its not as though we have not been in touch. We obviously have been in touch, in continuous touch for that matter. We still continue with our roadshows. We meet with all of you on a one-on-one basis or in groups or in the various broking houses that conduct their meets.. So in that sense, we certainly have been in touch. Vinita and Nilesh, of course, focused a lot on FY25 and took you through the strategies that we have for the future. And of course, give you a glimpse of what we intend doing over the next five years and how we are going to achieve our goals. But Im just going to focus on, in fact, the current year, what have we done in this particular quarter. The momentum for the current quarter was, of course, set a few quarters ago. So the last seven to eight quarters have been a period of continuous growth. And thats reflected in the numbers that you see out here as well. This quarter, again, it is great growth across various markets. The good thing about Lupin is the fact that its been secular growth across all markets. And this has come about the kind of products that we have introduced, which, of course, youll see in the next couple of slides. Equally, there has been good performance across all markets. And of course, a lot of focus across various lines. Nilesh and Vinita spoke about various initiatives that we have taken and all of those have borne fruit. Talking about, in fact, this particular quarter, US, of course, we had Mirabegron. We also had other products, like Prednisolone, Rivaroxaban and of course, the inline products of Albuterol, Spiriva®, which delivered. If you talk about the advanced markets in Europe, U.K., Luforbec® continues to do pretty well and of course totalling up pretty good growth. India, this particular quarter, it was seemingly lacklustre but the fact of the matter is we lost exclusivity on a couple of products when it came to diabetes. And of course the respiratory portfolio, the overall market itself has not performed too well. But clearly, if you compare year on year, we have done pretty well there as well. API, of course, the full year, we have done extremely well. The GIB business in API, of course, has done extremely well as well but its a cyclical business in a general sense. The most important story is really on the EBITDA and the last several quarters, we have seen continuous growth. This particular quarter, we ended up at 23.2%, but this is after taking into account a couple of things. The first is, essentially, you would see a INR 100 crore increase when it comes to the R&D expenditure and there has been a decline in terms of PLI that we claimed for this quarter, which is about INR 50 odd crores. So if you would adjust for these two, the actual EBITDA margin would have been close to about 26%. And the other thing that you should certainly take into account is the fact that some of our adjacencies that we started in recent times are still making a loss. Obviously, its a question of time before they also evolve and grow in size in critical mass and of course, contribute to the overall profits. If you were to May 15, 2025 take that into account, that would actually be good another 3.7 % points. So clearly, the EBITDA margins are in line with, in fact, the rest of the competition, the peer group and we have caught on pretty well. For the full year, of course, done extremely well. Last years margins were close to about 19%. Full year FY25, we are moving it at 23.7%. Clearly, the momentum has been maintained and more to come, as Vinita and Nilesh were saying. Clearly, we learn from history and whilst we have come a long way, its also equally important to see the magnitude of change. Lupin peaked way back in 2017-18, when we had products like Fortamet® and Glumetza®, that was a time when the entire industry was also doing pretty well. Lupin is, of course, at its peak. Our market cap was close to about USD 13.5 billion, but since then, a lot of water has flown and you would recognize that the entire structure of the industry changed quite a bit. First, we had the enactment of GDUFA, which changed in lots of ways the industry because there were faster approvals. Second is of course, the channel consolidation which happened in America which of course set us back because it was stacked against the manufacturers. Then of course COVID which struck. We also had our own systemic problems in terms of our five of our facilities were under OAI status and because of that, we were not getting approvals. So whilst we had a pipeline of close to about 109 molecules, we unfortunately were not getting the approvals to launch them and to that extent, the top line was not moving. The actual movement started in 2021 when we got our approvals for Albuterol and since then, the mojo was back. In 2022, we actually brought in a couple of other products also Posaconazole was one of the products. Then of course Brovana®. Brovana® is what we launched in 2022. In 2023, we had products like Xopenex® which came in. We also had Suprep®. In 2024, we had Spiriva® and before that, we had Darunavir and this year of course we have Mirabegron. All of this has brought in a tremendous change when it comes in fact to the top line. But more importantly, what it did was also increasing the gross margins. The quality of the products, it went up over time. Whilst we bottomed at around 58.3, this is the time when we were actually plagued by failure to supply, penalties because of that and of course, returns in America because of Nitrosamine products. All of this was something that we addressed with the team thats out here. And since then, the margins have crept up. The gross margins are now moving up. In 2024, we saw it at 66%. And this year, we closed at 69.2%, big increase over the last several quarters. Whilst we focused on, in fact, the mojo on the top line, bringing in good products, we didnt lose sight of, the various lines across the entire P&L. And as the leaders were saying, theres a lot of work done on every line of the P&L. We looked at the gross margins, in terms of alternate vendor development, routes to synthesis, productivity across various lines in terms of R&D, in terms of manufacturing, in terms of our sales force. All of this actually resulted in fact the expenses that we brought in line. We also undertook a mission to actually bring down cost by close to about, INR 750 to INR 1,000 crores. Nilesh just mentioned the fact that there has been good success in that and we saw the numbers as well. And you could actually see, while in FY20, other operating expenses was about 30.4% and FY21 was the period when you had COVID and there was a reduction in terms of sales and promotion expenses. May 15, 2025 But since then, a lot of the measures that we took have brought these lines back to less than 30%, something that we committed to the investing community some time ago. A lot of emphasis on moving to more complex products and though of course the R&D spends have been increasing as a percentage of sales, it has actually been kept constant around, about 8%. Though of course, you might actually see an absolute numbers and as a percentage of sales going up over the next few years. As a result of all of this, obviously, the EBITDA margins have grown continuously. The analyst community would talk to us and talk about the fact that our margins were less than their peers but we have addressed that. And as I was just telling you, we were at 23.8%, thanks to all of this. And if I were to knock out the impact of, in fact, the adjacencies and one times and the like, obviously, things would be much more. Capital expenditure has been contained. We addressed the footprint and still addressing that as well. A lot of the capital expenditure has already been done, not too much actually happening out there. From that perspective, we also find the free cash flows increasing. Theres been a lot of focus on operating working capital. You know, some time ago, we were the darling of the crowd when we had working capital of less than about 96-97 days. It went up over a time because, we lost sight of that for a period of time. We have addressed this issue and the focus has brought us back to pretty good operating working capital. The operating working capital today is amongst the best in the industry at just about 110. And obviously, all of this is also in much larger free cash flows. We are talking about a figure of about INR 1,330 crores this particular year after taking into account all the amounts that we expended in terms of capital expenditure, the increase in working capital and also in terms of investments for the M&A that we have done. You would be happy to know that we are now a cash surplus company. The overall net debt of the company is virtually zero. The ability to actually raise monies and go for acquisitions is far superior right now. All of this is, resulted in much higher ROCEs, which has been climbing over time. Today, its a good 22%. Still a far cry from what we were about a few years ago. We were 27% - 28%. And its a question of time we get to those levels. We would be looking at M&A because clearly, thats something which is important from our perspective to grow our specialty business. And of course, the growth in India. But clearly, there is a lot of focus on ROCE. We started our ESG journey quite several years ago but we were not articulating that in terms of our annual report. But today, the last three years, weve been to be reporting a lot of stuff in the integrated report and you would find that we have made pretty good progress out there. In terms of various frameworks that are there in existence, we have actually done extremely well. On a DJSI score, we have scored a high of about 75, last year, which is amongst the top three in the industry. We have got a lot of accolades across various frameworks, EcoVadis, in terms of UNGC, in terms of TCFD and May 15, 2025 all of this is reflected in the various metrics that we keep publishing from time to time. In terms of our goals itself, the number of goals that weve taken for FY30. Theres a lot of focus because we are passionate about it. Wed like to actually look at a very differentiated way of presenting this and taking this as in terms of our responsibilities and done a pretty good job there. Some of these are actually mentioned out here. Weve done a lot of stuff when it comes to climate change with, a 23% reduction till date whilst the goal is about 38%. In terms of water, I think we are leading the industry out there. And in recycling, about 50% by FY30. Similarly, there are lot of other goals that we have set and this is something which is very important especially from a European perspective. Thank you, friends. And with that, I think we could just move on to the question-and-answer session.",

This year, for example, we have Tolvaptan. And theres a host of other products that weve lined up for next several quarters. So, the margins would continuously go up. And we speak about the adjacencies, they would evolve in terms of growth and critical mass itself and start contributing profits.

And that’s what they are trying to do with this MFN clause, to negotiate pricing on brand drugs at a level similar to Europe. I don’t expect it to get to generic drugs very quickly because, generic drugs are already a pretty low spend. We have emphasized to the government as part of the Section 232 investigation in the commerce department that theres a lot of inefficiency in the supply chain. When you May 15, 2025 look at the generic side of the industry there is only a small percentage of the value that comes to the manufacturer, theres a big part that goes into the GPOs and PBMs and that’s where they need to focus to be able to gain efficiency. I think that is also, resonating with them. They are looking at the numbers and can see that how skewed the value chain is. So, we think that the PBMs are going to be challenged quite a bit. We have already started seeing some of that, a few of the states have already started dis- intermediating PBMs. I think that you are going to see potentially more negotiation with Big Pharma on brands. Again, to be seen how that syncs up with the reshoring goal that the administration has. And I see limited impact on generics.",

But I think you know with some of the China rhetoric, with some of the alternatives that people have been seeking as well I think it has become a large opportunity. It is also an opportunity that we can do at scale. I think there is multiple reasons why we are excited and we need to build. Once we have got numbers we will present those numbers but I don’t see anything coming as a challenge at this point of time. We have to build capability though. I think our key goal was commercial capability and project management. It is just operates at a very different level versus a generic company in that.

When you look at the changes that have taken place in the US. It is really creating opportunity for older products as well for us. For example, Pegfilgrastim it’s a very old product, multiple players in the marketplace. But as we have had conversations over the last year with the customer base the fact that we will come in with a new ASP that’s attractive for providers makes it a very attractive opportunity. So, we really see value in bringing Pegfilgrastim to market. Whether we do it ourselves or we do it with a partner is a question mark.. We have both options available to us. So, when you look at the other products, if you start looking at the first product that we had invested in was Etanercept - Enbrel®, and the idea with Enbrel® was global, we wanted to get into the US market, European market, everywhere we can and theres a submarine pattern that appeared in the US that held the product back until 2029. But we launched in Europe through Viatris, now Biocon, as well as other parts of the world through other partners. In the US we have the ability to bring the product into the market ourselves in s fiscal year 30. It will be a material opportunity for us because we likely will still be one of four in the marketplace. So, for us so far it has been a learning on the biosimilars front. We have tried to mitigate the risks through partnerships, partnerships on the development cost, partnerships on commercialization. In the last 12 months with the changes in the US we really see an opportunity of going direct into the market with biosimilars. Particularly for products like Pegfilgrastim May 15, 2025 certainly there is an opportunity. But also for the Ophthalmic products - the two products that we have on the Ophthalmic front, Ranibizumab and Aflibercept. we have the relationships with Ophthalmic distributors right now. AmerisourceBergen which is now Cencora is 70% of the ophthalmic market, they visit 70% of the ophthalmic clinics. So, we have the relationships in place to be able to enter that market if we get approval in time and can launch the product. Having said that going forward now given the barriers are reducing it becomes like a complex generic play for us. So, the focus is on products where the number of competitors are limited or where we can be one of few in the market place.",

      "content": "I think we are really coming into our own in some of these therapy areas. We have had all of the disruptions on the cardiovascular side. So, that’s all played out and the like. So, now we are seeing that 30% ahead of market growth. We see diabetes obviously with this happening, but we will still see good volume growth and I think we will still grow at a double digit in diabetes as well. Respiratory has been slow in the last couple of years. We have launched a new task force for nebulization, we have expanded our Uday Division which May 15, 2025 is focused on extra urban as well. That will lead to growth again as well. So, sum of it all I think we are going to grow at double digit and not just for the next year. I think the intent is to grow at 20-30% ahead of the market, I believe the market will grow at 6-7% or 8% as the case maybe. On top of that if you grow at 20-30% ahead you will be at that double digit. I think the sum of this all, trade generics we have launched into a separate subsidiary, that entity is expected to grow at a strong number. OTC is expected to grow at a very strong double-digit number as well. Summation of all of this adds up to a good double-digit number.",

One question is the US government has expressed a desire to reduce dependencies on PBMs and increase the transparency of drug pricing. And the question which is asked is does this lead to better predictability of drug pricing and is it a positive measure from a generic pricing perspective going ahead?",
