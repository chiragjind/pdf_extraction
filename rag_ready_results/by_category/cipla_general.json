So, versus last year, every quarter we will see a 4 million impact on account of rationalization for the next three quarters; however, this quarter we have also had the same supply challenges that we had guided even in the previous quarter call saying that we will have this issue for two quarters.

So, we do not know if it is going to play out exactly the same way because I think there is roughly about a month, a month or 45 day shift in just the way the monsoons came, the way the anti-infective season ran and the way that the winter is expected to come. So, there will be some of that swing. But yes, materially we do not think quarter 3 will be very different in terms of the structural foundations of the market and the demand compared to quarter 2.

So we are exploring multiple partnering options right now with various partners in terms of what we can do with this business. So I dont think the business is necessarily a business that will be completely 100% owned by Cipla. There could be a partnering option where we could invite some participation from another partner or merge with a significant player, right, in the Specialty business already.

I do not think all Rs.250 crores will be sustainable, but the more we are understanding of this of COVID now it is going to be endemic and will continue, may not be at the same level as right now but I think it is going to be endemic when we will continue. So I would like to believe that in its worst form I think about 30%, 35% of this should perhaps always be sustainable, that is my sense. I think the other thing that I would probably also say is that it also depends on cases. If there are no cases, then obviously there is no demand. But we have seen this pattern of cases go up and down, right, and the rest of the world is now going through a huge outbreak again. So, I think it would be responsive to those two, but I clearly see from a current level at least 25% to 30% seeing in the mix at least due to the endemic nature of this pandemic.",

And on Albuterol is the same, right, we used to be high, Cipla Limited October 27, 2023 then we came back down from the beginning to go back up again a little bit. So, it will be that and then quarter-on-quarter buying patterns theres always a little bit at a 200 million base, there could be 3-4 million here, there. So realistically from the previous quarter to this year, not so much of a delta, even though it was 215 to 230, I think some of these share increases, some of that 3, 4 million, buying pattern shift so I think youll roughly get there.",
