      "content": "A very warm welcome to everybody out here; very happy to have you back, especially when the results are so good. Im sure youve already gone through the results and a lot of youve already spoken to me and asked me a lot of questions. Indeed, when we began the year, we said the first two quarters are going to be little lackluster, but we did promise that the third quarter and fourth quarters, youll see a remarkable turnaround and more than that, actually. And we lived up to our own expectations. This fourth quarter, we closed our accounts with a record turnover, over INR 4,000 crores, for this particular quarter. Ive been advised that there are people from abroad joining in, and we have a call. So lets wait for a few more minutes. There are several qualitative aspects to our turnover for the quarter, of course, there is a 9% growth for the full year, when we speak about the performance vis-à-vis the previous quarter that is 22% up, 34% up vis-à-vis the last year itself. While these are a good set of numbers, we are happier with the gross margins performance also; 74% for this particular quarter and if you look at the performance for the year, it is 68.7% while it’s even higher than in the last year. It goes to show the quality of the products we launched in the market fourth quarter. Of course, it follows through with the EBITDA margins - which for this quarter was 34% whilst for the full year it is still a tad lower than the last year, but I would attribute that a very high R&D expenditure over Rs.500 crores, which would have translated another 3 percentage points. If we add both, we come to EBITDA margins even higher than last year. Of course, the PBT, again, despite the fact that the R&D expenditure was high - was higher than last year and if not for that for the higher quantum of tax, the PAT itself would have been considerably high. And on that last note, may I request Dr. KKS to make the presentation? Dr. Kamal K Sharma: Good Evening, Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you, Ramesh for those opening remarks. You’ve already seen the results, and Ramesh gave you a snapshot of where the financials have worked out. I think, I’m going to walk you through some of the industry trends as they are mopping, and how does Lupin that come in the face of those trends, and finally look at the quick dive into the financials, and end by saying as to what we are going to be doing, in the coming years. So, when we speak about the trends, something which has been very prominent in the recent past, is the erosion in prices in the US. And as you are aware that there has been substantial consolidation of the channel partners, and therefore it has obviously helped them to improve their bargaining power and the differential price in that one could earlier enjoy that is no more there. So, there is a block price for a group of channel partners, and I think the last one which happened was recently was Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 McKesson and Walmart, right. So, that really has been -- you know, generally, the US market -- Generic market will experience about 4% to 5% price reduction, of which at least 50% one would be able to make up through operational efficiencies but this particular episode has led to double-digit reduction to the tune of 14-15%. Of course, what is positive, is a better score on approvals by FDA. There has been substantial improvement in that area which had hithered towards deficient. When it comes to India, we are all aware that NLEM has set a new order as far as the Indian business is concerned. And whatever was the impact of the first NLEM policy, there has been further reinforced with what has happened in 2015 and the latest one that we have been dealing with is the ban on fixed dosage combinations, there is a temporary respite for part of them because we have a stay order but how it’s going to pan out is anybody’s guess. In sum and substance, there is a pressure on the business in terms of control on prices and ability to launch new products. Japan - the government has been progressively working towards improving the penetration of Generics, it is targeting 70% by 2017 and 80% by 2020. But on the other side, Japanese administration is also pushing prices down, I think, earlier we used to experience reduction in price every two years, now it’s become an annual feature which is not a very good news. There has been substantial consolidation in the industry in the last 2.5-years; M&A of $500 billion has happened and most of you have been reading in the papers of the major mergers which have taken place in the recent past. Another development which is worth citing here is that Biosimilars which is kind of a new wave in Generic market. They are now seeing a lot of traction on the guidelines, pathways from the regulators in Europe and in America and hopefully in the next few years there would be a lot more clarity in taking these to the markets. There are already instances where US is approving Biosimilars for the market. The year witnessed a lot of penalties from USFDA on the manufacturing plants. And while we have had a stellar record, we did not escape the heat and we will talk about that. Coming specifically to United States. What is in store for us in terms of trends, is that the Generic penetration is expected to rise from the current 88% to 92%. Between now and 2020 there is likelihood of $92 billion worth of patent expiration, which is an opportunity in Generics. This obviously augurs very well for the business. We also understand that the lion share of Generic goes to oral solid dosage forms, and a lot more needs to be done in the alternative forms. And the generic industry despite all the consolidation that we keep hearing about and we keep witnessing remains very Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 fragmented and in that sense if you see the top five operators in generics in the United States have lost their contribution from 55% to 51%, market share has come down. This is what I will say, meaning, when I said that the dominant share is with the Oral Solid Dosage form, in the slide that we see on the screen, you would see that there are 47 players in the OSD whereas as you go to the right of the slide you would see that there are a lesser number of players and there is a lot of concentration in the hands of few. The idea of sharing this information with you is to say that there is a lot of scope to grow in alternative dosage forms other than OSD and that’s what, is the world of Complex Generics and specialty which we’re pursuing in the company. What does this trending mean for Lupin in particular? I think we’ve already started our journey towards Complex Generics, we need to focus on it a lot more, we need to build Specialty both internally as well as through acquisition and partnerships. In India, I think the way the trends are, if we are going to be controlled on new launches, if there’s going to be price pressure, I think, the alternative is to increase your prescriber base and as we have demonstrated in the past we need to create more alliances: a) we need to go deeper into the existing alliances, as I speak with you we have four alliances in India with multinationals, and whatever we are doing with them, we need to go deeper, in addition, b) we need to tie up with more partners, so that the growth is ensured. Likewise in Japan, I think if one wants to deal with the price pressure, the only way it can be done is to launch more products and -- in order to do that I think we need to seek more strategic partnerships and of course we are already undertaking capacity expansion in Japan to be able to serve the market better. As far as M&A is concerned, I think we have stated in the past and our policy remains as we have said in earlier that Lupin would look at select areas of brand and specialty and niche technology platforms when it comes to merger and acquisitions. We’ve also stated earlier about our geographic expansion endeavor and I must say that in future you might witness some bolt-on acquisition, but by and large, as far as the geographic expansion is concerned for the company, we seem to be there, I think what we need to do is really now make these new acquisitions grow and consolidate them rather than expand geographically any further. Derived from the focus on Complex Generics and Specialty, I think it is a natural corollary that the R&D investments have to get enhanced in Complex Generics and the Specialty area and also in Biologics and you already see that escalation happening as we will discuss the financials. Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 As far as the execution is concerned, I think we’ve always revered for flawless execution and operational excellence is one of the key drivers of our effort there. We want to make sure that we are cost leaders in whatever we do. And that brings me to sharing with you, what we have been sharing in the past too as to how we see Lupin mopping, from a Generic - Branded Generic Company till now into Complex Generics, Specialty Company going forward and the share of Complex Generics and Specialty has to increase with the Generic component of the business. Generic would always remain a very lion piece of the business, as you know that, at any given time, very large part of illness is served by patent expired drugs. So one cannot do with that but larger attention would be received by Specialty and Complex Generics in our business. So that’s about the trends that we are kind of witnessing in the industry. In the face of those trends, I think its worthwhile looking at how Lupin stacks up to this challenge. I think one feels very proud to share journey of last 10-years with the audience here. It has been a stellar performance by any standards. If you look at the market capitalization, I think, there’s a compounded annual growth rate of 32% from kind of Rs.41 billion to Rs.667 billion. Revenues have registered a growth of 24% in the same period. R&D expenditure has also gone up with 31% growth and this is something which -- you know, R&D is a key driver of our business endeavor in Pharmaceuticals and therefore requisitely we’ve been investing in the priority areas in R&D. What is most heartening is the quality of our business where you see our EBITDA margins growing at annual compounded rate of growth 29%. There were times when we were struggling around the 10% and you know 18-19% for a long time. We’ve crossed that barrier and we are now around 30%. Likewise, net profit also has shown very promising growth of 29%. So that speaks about the way we have organizationally strengthened our company. As a consequence of that, we are today 7th Largest Generic Company Globally by Market Cap, 9th Largest Company by Revenues, we are the Third Largest Indian Pharma Company by Global Sales, #1 Anti-TB Company which is our Legacy business, we are the 5th Largest Company in the United States by Prescriptions; we have a prescription share of 5.6-5.7%, we are the 9th Largest Generic Company in Japan, 8th Largest Indian Pharma Company and the 4th Largest Generic Company in South Africa and #1 Cardiovascular Company in South Africa. With the good work that the team has done, it has brought along the accolades that the team deserves. The notable ones, that I may mention here in the long list that is in front of you, is being designated as Outstanding Company of the Year by CNBC- TV18, Lupin was ranked as “15th Best Place to Work for in Asia” by Great Places to Work Institute, we have been ranked as one of the best employer of 2016 in India by Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 AON. Vinita Gupta and Nilesh were awarded the Entrepreneur of the year award by Ernst & Young. Vinita has been in the focus for various awards, as you can see the list there and I think the notable one has been the Power 50 Women in Business and last but not the least is Ramesh Swaminathan who has been recognized as The Best CFO by FinanceAsia. When we speak about Lupin today and how it stacks up against the trends and the challenges that I shared in the beginning of the presentation, I think what we are doing with our head down as a team in the company, is to build a global footprint for the company, both through the internal development of capabilities as well as acquiring capabilities from the outside through M&A, wherever we feel either the lead times are going to be very long or we just don’t have the wherewithal from within to build those capabilities. And in that regard, you would see here, that we have set up a state-of-the-art R&D facility in Florida for Inhalation, we have our first Biosimilar order for Pune facility getting into Phase-III Etanercept, we had a stellar launch of Glumetza and a lot of positive movement that we are seeing today is because of that and we hope to continue to do launches like that in future too. On the Inorganic side, we used to hold 60% equity in the South African company, is now 100% ours, so we acquired the 40% remaining equity from the erstwhile promoter, we have acquired a business in Brazil Medquimica, we have acquired Gavis which is our largest acquisition and one of the largest out of India, we also acquired a small CNS portfolio in Germany called Temmler. We’ve always said that you know our inorganic play would be not to chase size but to chase quality. And I think that’s what the slide here would show you that of the entire growth story that Lupin has experienced, 20% of our revenue comes out of inorganic endeavors or inorganic interventions and 80% of that is really our organic effort. So that speaks for the team, as to how well integrated they have been, in terms of achieving the kind of target that we had set for ourselves, which have always been very stretched. And I think another highlight of the journey is that whatever we acquire along the way that too has grown extremely well. So if you see Kyowa that we acquired in October 2007 has registered a compounded annual growth rate of 16% on constant foreign exchange. Likewise the South African asset Pharma Dynamics has grown 25% in the period. So, that shows that whatever we acquired has also been producing results and growing at a very healthy clip. Gavis which is now called Lupin Somerset is our biggest and by far the latest acquisition. And while we were kind of endeavoring to have it by mid of last year, but we could close it only towards the early part of this year, but what is important is that performance is on track, the integration is complete, we have a new leader there, who is an extremely competent person and we hope that whatever we have planned, Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 in terms of tripling the turnover of Lupin Somerset from the time of acquisition, we will definitely be hitting the bull’s eye there. What is even more interesting to share with you that in the portfolio of Gavis, we could get to reach for our Branded business. You know that we are very proud of our Branded business, but for various reasons it had been going down because we lost intellectual property rights on a particular product, it became Generic on Suprax, but these two new leads - one on Methergine which is for Women’s Health and other one, you know, methylphenidate chewable tablets for the Pediatric ADHD indication is giving a new lead to our Branded business and also gives us little more time to really push hard in terms of other efforts that we have been making in building that business. I think you are all aware that in terms of net effect of Gavis on Lupin’s portfolio it has added 28 products to our marketed products, so total 124 products are there in the market today. There are 9 controlled substances and 01 dermatology product out of this basket. There are about 102 cumulative filings, of which 58 are pending and additional 66 products are under development. Lupin has a good score in terms of our total filings; now we have filed, between Lupin and Lupin-Somerset that is our new facility, Gavis, 343 filings, of which 180 have been approved and balance are awaiting approval. What has been more heartening, is that we have total 256 products under development between the two facilities. So that should give you an idea as to how the future is going to pan out with this rich pipeline of products which is getting ready, with 163 awaiting approval and 256 getting into the pipeline. We have spoken about our journey. I think we have been continuously traversing this nexus of complexity where our risk will slightly go up but rewards will substantially go up and you know in business where you have risk, you have rewards. And if you see the chart in front of you, you would see that our journey is defined in the chart starting with Oral Contraceptives. On the right hand side of the chart, you see the total market potential that one is trying to address through this effort and on the left you see the various components of this effort that together constitute riding the wave of complexity as far as the business is concerned. Starting with Oral Contraceptives where we have 21 products in the market, 10 are pending approval. Moving on to Ophthalmology, where we have 2 products in the market, 7 filings are awaiting approval and there are more developments happening; Dermatology, as I said a while ago, we have 1 product from Gavis portfolio and 24 filings, further development is ongoing. And on to Controlled Substances, which is again a very cohesive area for business and we started making efforts in Injectables Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 last two years. We acquired a R&D facility in Netherlands in the name of Nanomi and between LRP, that is Pune facility and Nanomi, will be developing a set of Complex Injectables. We set up this R&D for Inhalation in Florida, which has already made 2 filings; 1 MDI is under clinical trial and we hope to commence trial of the DPI device during this year. And then of course we have a Biosimilars program in India, where we have 10 products under development and one of them Etanercept is entering Phase-III for Japan. And of course, we have a program on new drug discovery where we have 10 new chemical entities, 4 of them are in clinical trials currently. Talking about Global Footprint: I think very rightly we have today manufacturing facilities, 12 sites in India, 2 in Japan, 1 in United States, 1 in Mexico and 1 in Brazil. We also have a research facility in Pune in India. Also, a small research facility in Aurangabad to augment the Generic development. We have research facilities in Japan, one for Injectable, one for Oral Solid Dosage. We have R&D facilities in Somerset and we have also small R&D facilities in Mexico and in Brazil and of course Nanomi in Netherlands. So that’s truly the mark of a global footprint where we have multiple manufacturing organization and multiple research facility to really pool into overall effort of moving up the complexity chain and reaching our target that we have set for ourselves. I said in the beginning that the rigor of inspections have gone up from FDA, for good reasons, at the same time, I think -- for example, - last one year we have faced about 12, so -- and there have been times when two sites are being inspected at the same time, so that would just tell you as to how much extra vigilance is happening in - on this count. We have had a very good record as far as compliance is concerned since 2009, but in the recent past, yes, we also face the heat as I mentioned earlier. The major among these observation has been only Goa where we had a repeat inspection from the FDA, we have responded to the observations and we have provided an update thereafter which is kind of in regular good order and we are now working for a holistic transformation. In a matter of speaking, the transformation is never complete here because the goal post keeps changing, so you have to continuously work to keep on the effort and if at all there is any failing, it is our own failing to live up to certain speed of the target changing. From time to time the prescription from the FDA undergo change, the new employees come, the training needs - need to be augmented and therefore there are times when one has challenges to face, but we are very confident that we are going to be able to deal with it like we did it in the past in 2009. So that, kind of gives you a snapshot of how Lupin today stacks up to the trends and the challenges, as are presented to work in the industry. Now, a quick Business Update for you: Ramesh has already shared this with you, you have the results with you I think, Q4 has been an epoch making quarter for us. It is a record turnover of Rs.4,000 crores plus and a record net profit of Rs.800 crores Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 plus. Obviously, this is riding on major contribution from United States apart from other geographies like India and Japan which have also turned out very good performance. In fact, what is heartening about Lupin is that all geographies have turned out good performance, notwithstanding FOREX pressure in the emerging markets where the local currency has been depreciating, but since US is a lion share of our revenue, obviously, what happens in the US affects our overall results rather more penetratingly either in other geographies. In terms of the annual results, as you know that we started off last year, the first two quarters were under challenge. We spoke about the price pressures in America, we spoke about the NLEM effect you know the price reduction there and in face of all that, we never had any new products in the first two quarters, so one of the ways to combat pressures of prices is really to be able to launch new products, but unfortunately, we had pretty dry spell in the first two quarters, it was from Q3 onwards that we started, you know, getting better; we did a reasonable job in the Q3, but Q4 has been fantastic. Overall, the year witnessed a very moderate growth of 8.7 % in the top line. The net profit appears like recording slight decline of 5.5%; however, we maintain the PBT despite a severe hike in our R&D expenditure. As Ramesh was mentioning to you that this 28.8% EBITDA that you see here is, you give cognizance of the Rs.500 crores extra expenditure that we have done in R&D which is again done for the future, so there is no concern on that account because this is all going towards building IP for the future in terms of clinical development product, but just for the sake of a perspective, if that were to not to be spent, the EBITDA margin will be 32.4%, as against 30.6% of previous year, that will all flow into the PBT line. Adding to that with our unsold inventory and the tax paid on that, our tax rate has been 5% higher than previous year. So all that put together, reflects into what you see is the net bottom line of the company. It is not to justify, it is just to share with you some of the real happenings in the business. Now, talking about some of the Major Geographies -- US: The overall business has shown a growth on corresponding quarter as well as on sequential quarters; 54%. And, this is all in dollar terms as you see on your screen. And as I mentioned that because the first two quarters were absolutely dry for a new product and we’ve done a lot of bucking up in the Q3 and Q4, the year ended up in US as flat. However, there have been some remarkable achievements in the US, as you know that Lupin is a supplier of four of the top ten most commonly dispensed products in United States, we are #5 by Prescription in the US, we have a very handsome pipeline of products as we spoke a while ago with 343 ANDA filings, of which, you know, 180 are approved and Somerset facility has substantially added to that particular portfolio. Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 We had 39 approvals during the year, of which 25 were for Lupin and 14 from Lupin Somerset.",

      "content": "Despite all the pressures has grown 6% over the year. It is 9th largest generic company. You know that it’s a strong company in CNS, Cardiovascular, and Gastroenterology. We’re actually building a new dedicated site for Oral Solid Dosage, also there is a new Injectable line coming up in Japan. In Japan, it is material to have a relationship with national distributors, 4 of them, we have recently got into an alliance with one of the national distributors, we only do some business with 2 of them I think we are now trying to expend on our exposure at the national level. This should augur very well for the company in terms of getting a larger share of the distribution piece. In the rest of the businesses also, as I said, Lupin always has this positive side that we are able to have a secular growth in all our markets. And this is even more meaningful here that what you see on the slide that whatever you see here is despite a pressure on the foreign exchange devaluation in most of the emerging markets. South Africa business has grown 10%, it is the Fourth Largest Generic Company as I mentioned earlier and the #1 Cardiovascular Company. Philippines had a fantastic record of growth of 42% as against industry growth of 9% and is ranked 22nd. Latin America- our Mexican company Lab Grin is the 2nd Largest Ophthal Company by Volume but the 4th largest by revenue. And Brazil, which is Medquimica, is rather new in our system, so we have just to see as to how it mops up, we obviously have plans to grow that business. Europe did well this time; Hormosan, which had been giving us some concerns at times was rather going up and down, we definitely see very clear signs of turning around, it’s now making profit and as I mentioned earlier, Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 we also have acquired a company Temmler which adds to the CNS portfolio of Germany. API business is the strong pillar for Lupin because it feeds all our formulation endeavors. We’ve had a certain slowness in the growth because we have an old portfolio but a lot of new initiatives have been taken in API in terms of adding new line of therapy, new line of APIs, those are going to mop over next two to three years. What is even more heartening that now the API business is going to participate in advanced markets, as you see here, there are 172 US DMF filings, 16 of which were made in this particular year and once they come up, you obviously see a high quality business being added to this portfolio, so that should augur extremely well for the API business of the company. I think we have spoken about R&D that as we move up the complexity curve, I think there is little choice, but to put in more money in R&D, because as you get into the world of Complex Generics and Specialty, Biosimilars, New Drug Discovery of course, there is a lot more clinical development that we have to do and that takes in a lot of money. So as you would see that over last year -- in this year- our R&D expense has gone up by 3%. Just in Q4, the R&D investment was 12.5% of our sales, but you also saw the pipeline that we are developing for future and it takes all that to really be able to bring that to reality. At the same time, I think one is very conscious of the fact that when we are investing in R&D, we need to make sure that our research pipeline really delivers. We continue to invest a lot of money and time in building a good pool of people in addition to what we have in India, as you know now, we have also very strong R&D in United States and the other geographies, where we today have acquired businesses. We’ve already shared the pipeline, so I’m not going to repeat that here. So, having looked at the industry trends, having shared with you as to how does Lupin stack up to those trends, then a quick pen picture of how the financials have come through over the time is now you know - is now to leave you with what are we going to be doing in the company and you see some of the key buckets here for our future endeavors. Very clearly, in Generics, I think we have to grow US and Japan by new launches and grow base business, increase penetration in emerging markets, that’s very clearly the objective. When it comes to Specialty, we have to continue and reinforce our effort to build Specialty both organically as well as inorganically and we are in the process of building a Specialty pipeline. As far as R&D is concerned, I think the task is cut out because in Pharmaceuticals business there are two drivers - key drivers of the business. I sometimes like to add the third one. The R&D on one hand, Marketing the second and maybe Operational Excellence which becomes overriding, rest everything else is a Service function if you really look at Pharma. So R&D is a Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 lifeline of our business and we will continue to deliver on the pipeline and we will evolve the Complex Generics and Specialty pipeline over time, the effort has already started showing up, you will see that in coming quarters. I said that a while ago Operational Excellence, Cost Leadership, High Efficiency, Optimal Time Cycles is the order of the day. You have to remain lean and I think that’s what our endeavor is as far as operational excellence is concerned. Compliance is going to remain a major challenge in our business and we all understand that if you’ve hooked for non- compliance, what it can cost you and therefore that would always remain an area of high interest. With that, I come to an end of my presentation. Thank you very much. I think we can now take questions and we will deal with the questions as they come. Do you have some? Okay, Alpesh is saying that we will have questions from the live audience and alternatively also with the connected audience.",

Lupin Limited October 30, 2017 To give more color on that, US declined by about 15% principally because of, pricing pressure and of course because of loss of exclusivity continuing on Glumetza and Fortamet. India did spectacularly well at 24.3%. APAC is also growing at 6.1%. Philippines, growing at 44%. EMEA growing by 22.1% including South Africa growing at 29%. Germany is also growing at 13.4%. Latin America vis-à-vis the previous quarter grew by 9.9%. But vis-à-vis previous year again Latin America is growing at 41.5%. Mexico a stupendous 66.2% and Brazil by 30.1%. vis-à-vis the previous year. We have done really well across various regions. EMEA grew by 17.1%, APAC grew by 15.2%. India vis-à-vis last year was 16.4%. But of course, the decline was principally in the US itself. In terms of EBITDA margins, at the beginning of the year we talked about a range of about 21% to 23%. Im very pleased to present that we were able to maintain about 23.9% for this particular quarter. So of course, we were aided by tailwinds in terms of FOREX and R&D spends itself were lower at 12.2% of sales. And then, as Nilesh promised, our R&D figure is going to be in the Rs 500 crores range on a quarterly run rate basis. There are couple of things which are actually disconcerting, essentially the working capital.As you would have noticed, it has gone up during the course of this particular quarter. But we do know that we have taken active taken steps to bring it down and we would see results coming in Q3 and Q4. Whilst I was speaking to some of you in the course of last couple of hours, you wanted to know more about what the guidance would be for the next two quarters. We believe that the sales have hit the bottom and we would do better in the next 2 quarters. With that, I would like to open the floor for discussions.",

We saw 5% QoQ growth this quarter aided by forex of course, but also the base business grew 3% in local currency terms led by the generic business. The brand business witnessed some pressure, as you would recall in the last quarter we had a generic to Methergine that fully played out in Q2. So, the brand business was rather down QoQ, while the generic business was up primarily led by existing products, as we really didnt have any material new product launch during the quarter. It was primarily based on additional business that we picked up as a result of some supply-chain issues of peers and we are seeing more and more of these situations. Its actually a healthy sign as far as we are concerned. The US market is gone through a lot of pressure over the last couple of years, but we are starting to see some level of stabilization and moderation in price erosion setting in. In the last year or so, we have seen companies like Mylan, Teva get out of multiple products in their portfolio presumably because they had reached a threshold below which it was not feasible for them to continue to manufacture the product. So, we are seeing this supply disruption more and more which is a very healthy sign for the industry. We benefited from some of that in Q2 and we expect to continue to see this trend in the next couple of quarters. So, that plus the price moderation on the generic front, the upcoming flu season coupled with key launches in Q4 should help us grow our US business in the coming quarters. With the flu season coming up, we Lupin Limited October 31, 2018 expect the Tamiflu franchise as well as the cephalosporin franchise to contribute more in Q3 and Q4. And with Ranexa as well as Levothyroxine, we would expect good contribution in Q4. On the brand side of the business while Q1 and Q2 have been significant investments, we have seen a good ramp up in Solosec both in terms of prescriptions as well as managed care access, up now to 68% of unrestricted access and 90% plus overall access with some restrictions. This has been really positive, very encouraging for us to see this kind of access for the product this early in ramp up, early in the evolution. So we expect Solosec also to contribute more to our revenues in Q3 and Q4 as well as see the full-year impact in the next fiscal year. With that I would like to open it up to questions.",

So, that is one of the major reasons. And API’s as well as the intermediate they have been now shifted to the Indian business. So, at least, we as Lupin Limited October 31, 2018 a company, have a very strong position in seven, eight molecules where we have been a global leader. So, that gave us an opportunity and we foresee that for the next four, five years, API growth story for the country as a whole will be much better. And if you look at the growth rate, even the exports of the API from India has grown up by 12% compared to last year. So, the API story both in terms of the manufacturing base in India as well as reduction in the supplies in China, and another area which will come very strongly from India will be the fermentation-based products. So, I feel this story will continue and Lupin is a committed player in the API business for a long time.",

      "content": "So maybe I can answer, Vinita can add and why are we at 18% to 20%. First of all, we are seeing tepid growth in markets like U.S., specifically in the U.S. generics front. We are investing heavily in specialty, so theres a full burn rate going on Solosec. And we are investing ahead of the curve on R&D. As youve seen on R&D, our spend is amongst the highest. Why is it the highest? Its because we have multiple bets on inhalation, we have complex injectables and we have a few select biosimilars going on as well. We feel very good about our portfolio. We feel very good about the R&D that we are doing. Obviously, we are very cognizant of the Solosec Lupin Limited February 06, 2020 burn and - we are very attuned. Part of the things that Vinita talked about even in the last 3 months was a new leadership team, a new head that we brought in for the specialty business, people like Alan that we brought in on the corporate development side are also extremely strong on the specialty side. And obviously, our focus is on building that part of the business. Theres more than commensurate burn happening on the specialty side. - Generics is at a low as far as the profitability is concerned because of the R&D spend that goes into that business as well, obviously, by itself. And if you were not to spend the R&D, theres a very high level of profitability. So - that is a function of the R&D spend that we are doing. These I would call out as the big elements. As we look and as we go forward, we obviously expect growth in generics. So not just in the complex generics, but in oral solids as well, we expect growth in the next 1 year, 2 years. We see the inhalation portfolio starting from next year, not just in the U.S., but products like Fostair in Europe as well. We see injectables, weve launched the first of our injectable in December, obviously, its small, but again, the intent would be to build it forward. And weve still not delivered from areas like Nanomi, we are very happy with some of the progress weve made, but we still need to make filings, get approvals. So, theres a lot of stuff that we are investing in right now, which we are not getting return on. But we could optimize that to make sure that if we were to bring that R&D percentage down by 3% or 4%, that will go to the EBITDA line. But well be cutting our long-term future short. We see inhalation as a major growth driver in the future. We see biosimilars, even though we are only taking select opportunities, but we see biosimilars as a very solid growth driver as well. And on the third level, the injectables. We feel good about specialty, right, but we are also cognizant of the fact of the burn. We’re obviously looking at what is the best way to optimize that as well. So thats the reason why we always said that well stay at this 18%, 20%. The idea would be to basically improve by 1 or 2 percentage points each year, especially as the business takes off again, specifically U.S. generics and the specialty.",

But as we look at some of these areas right now in the near term, you look at inhalation, which is important part of our growth driver in the next couple of years. And specifically look at the product filings, whether its albuterol in the U.S., Fostair in Europe, Spiriva in the U.S. and the facilities they are from like Pithampur Unit 3, which has gone through FDA inspection, gone through European inspections, and we feel good about the ability to get approved for these products and supply out of there. Likewise, on the biosimilars front, which, again, is a material growth driver in the next couple of years, we have received approval in Japan, we have received approval in Australia. Expect that we should be able to get product approval also in Europe and then U.S., of course, for pegfilgrastim and other products in the future. Over the last couple of years, there have been a lot of learnings along the way. As we get closer to this point, we feel good about our ability to be able to monetize this investment and this pipeline over the next few years.",

We have our inhalations portfolio, we have biosimilars, we have specialty and complex injectables and the like, but all of those will happen over time. But one thing thats constant out there is, trying to read out the boundaries when it comes to, on the cost front. This is going to be across several lines. Weve had a continuous engagement program with leading consultants working on several lines. We have a program to implement on the procurement front, which is really the raw materials, alternate vendors and the route synthesis and conversion. We are working on SG&A, the R&D expense front and for sure on the overall workforce itself. So we have actually seen some good results through the course of this year. Its not so visible to you because its actually camouflaged in several parts. And there are several moving parts there itself, amongst lines. But as we unfold and as we go into the future, I would imagine there would be significant visibility on that, towards the end of the next fiscal, that is you would actually see a closing date which is certainly Lupin Limited May 29, 2020 superior. But all of this, assuming that normalcy returns in terms of the business. As you would know, the first quarter would be impacted because of COVID across various parts of the globe.

So those are again, something that we cant actually talk about, but in a general sense, you would expect that there is going to be tremendous focus on cost, and that would be contained.",

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Sharma. Dear friends, welcome to our Q1FY21 results webinar. This is the first time we are conducting the results discussion through the digital platform and I believe that if we find this suitable, we will continue this format in the subsequent quarters as well. Let me take you through the key aspects of our Q1 performance. We had already guided for a tough quarter, because we had felt the tremors of the same, due to the impact of COVID-19 in May itself. We felt that the impact of market disruption could be across all the regions including two of our largest markets, India, and the US. However, our API business outperformed this quarter. At Rs.3,468 crores, overall revenues were lower than the previous quarter by 8.5% and lower than previous year by 9.1%. The US business performed steadily at US$ 180 - 190 million over the whole of last year. We saw this reaching US$ 212 million in the last quarter i.e. Q4FY20. However, the US sales declined by 26% sequentially and 28% YoY to US$ 157 million. This was because of demand contraction by 12% versus the previous quarter and over 6% vis-à-vis the previous year. The seasonality factor also played in and therefore we saw loss of sales in the Oseltamivir, Azithromycin & Cephalosporins business and there is impact of Metformin as well. In India, where we have consistently performed over several quarters, there was COVID impact and India region branded formulations declined 6% YoY, especially the acute products. As per IQVIA, Lupin’s growth in Q1 was -1.4%, whilst for the IPM it was -4.9%. In June, there was some demand revival but there was disruption again in July. But we do expect Q2 to be much better than Q1 as demand picks up again from August. As said before, API sales showed significant growth of 24.5% sequentially with strong positive momentum on demand Lupin Limited Aug 7, 2020 as well as pricing. We expect the strong double-digit growth YoY to continue. On the gross margin front, we did well to actually sustain it at 62.9%, and this despite the fact there was sharp decline in US business as I had stated before, and also the impact of higher freight cost. But all the same, we were able to maintain the margins underlined improvements in overall business. Manpower cost increase in this quarter is on account of one time spent in terms of specialty restructuring in the US and COVID linked incentives. However, we do believe from Q2 onwards, we would expect the recurring benefits due to the specialty restructuring and we expect the overall absolute number to be lower than Q4FY20. Overall, on the manufacturing & other expenses, including the freight (the freight element was captured in terms of gross margins itself), expenses were higher by close to Rs.100 crores. However, there was significant fall in manufacturing & other expenses in terms of travel, legal & consulting fees, sales promotion expenses and the like. As you would recognize it was not possible to call on doctors, so there was considerable saving on that, promotions did not take place and so on. It is not necessarily something wholly sustainable but having said that it would be our endeavor to take digital means and try to sustain it at levels which are lower than the past. As we normalize the operations, we do expect some increase in the SG&A expenses but the savings to some extent will certainly continue. On the EBIDTA front we are happy to report an operating EBIDTA improvement of 1% over the last quarter but recognize this is without including FOREX and other income. We are confident that this EBIDTA trajectory will continue to improve in Q2 and beyond. I had guided for close to 19-20% which included other income and Fx impact as well, but had also added a caveat that this is before taking into account the situation on account of COVID. We re-evaluated the entire thing and we do believe that we should be to able to close at about 17% without any impact of FOREX or other income. In terms of the outlook we expect operating margin to improve, as we expect market share expansion of Levothyroxine and relaunch of Glumetza before the end of Q2. Additionally, customers start their winter buying and this should help products like Azithromycin, Cephalosporins and, Oseltamivir. Further, we look forward to the much-awaited launch of Albuterol in September-20. In addition, we have also partnered for a few products that we will be launching in next couple of months. Aided by tight control on manpower costs, SG&A expenses and rationalization of costs on the specialty front, we believe that we will be in position to boost the margins. In terms of the ETR which has been a sore point, it remains high this quarter, but we expect this to improve in H2FY21 with ramp up in sales and the specialty restructuring. For the full year we believe that ETR would be between 35% - 40%. With this we would like to open the floor for discussions. Lupin Limited Aug 7, 2020",

Some of the savings which will not replicate are the ones which are related to field staff. When they are working from home, allowances and the like is what you can save which becomes a significant number. Obviously for Lupin Limited Aug 7, 2020 the rest of the year there is a lot of stuff like conferences and many more which would not happen in all likelihood. Certainly, international travel to conferences would not happen either. So, there would be savings which would happen in the course of the year. But if you go beyond COVID, this has been a really great opportunity for us to embrace the digital. We have done 3,200 CME’s to date; we have done 200 training sessions for our representatives. The numbers are huge. There is a very large wholesome embracement of all things digital at this point of time. I do not think that it changes the market completely, like I said, more than 90% of representative are back on job. Our call average is between 6 to 7 per day. So, there is a fair bit of the old which is coming back as well. It is a great opportunity to go beyond as well.",

There are multiple milestones that we will hit on inhalation. There are other assets that are under development, filings as well. So, its a critical year from the inhalation perspective. On biosimilars at this point of time, it is Etanercept from a launch perspective, which we intend to launch this quarter in Europe. By the end of the year, we expect to file our Pegfilgrastim as well. Again, multiple milestones in biosimilars that will be there. And then switching to the compliance, weve had a very solid first half. The inspections that we had in the first quarter, were all positive in terms of outcome and we had slated this ought to be the year of completely earning back our rightful space on the compliance front. Obviously, with COVID, and with the restrictions with the FDA not really being in a position to do audits, theres a bit of a limbo at this point on our OAI facilities. But I think the momentum is to continue and we are aligned with FDA in that, everybody wants supply continuity, everybody wants facilities that are compliant to be up and running. Were working with the FDA; weve made a lot of progress at sites. Somerset, we have already put up for re-inspection, Goa & Pithampur, both of these are possibly in the next month going to be ready for re-inspection. And were going to really work with FDA to see what the best way would be. I dont think theres a stated remote virtual audit process. There is certainly a document review process, there is a mutual recognition process as well. Well have to push the envelope and see what the best way will be to do it. But, again, from our own internal development, theres a lot of strength, which has been built on the compliance front. And we certainly expect to take this to the finish line.",

From a portfolio evolution standpoint, we have significant opportunities starting with the rollout of a complex generic assets this year - Albuterol and Fostair on the inhalation front, plus, Enbrel on the biosimilars front, on the specialty front with NaMuscla which is ramping up very nicely as well in Europe. We are looking at the potential of getting it into the US market and building on Solosec on the specialty front in the US. As we look at the next couple of years, we have a whole Lupin Limited Aug 7, 2020 pipeline of these complex generic assets and these platforms playing out after Albuterol and Fostair this year. We expect in the next year we’ll have other inhalation products - Brovana that we are approved for, Perforomist that we expect to get approved for, Dulera that we have filed, and then Spiriva in the following year. So, the inhalation portfolio will play a material part in the next couple of years. On the biosimilars front with Enbrel starting this year, and full year impact next year, plus pegfilgrastim coming into the market in FY23, and you start seeing impact of biosimilars in the US and Europe over the next two years. And then the injectable portfolio coming thereafter. We really see all of the investments that we have made in the complex generic front, we are right at the inflection point to benefit from it in the next couple of years driving top line growth, hopefully on an annualized basis. But in a 5-year timeframe, double digit growth.",

Its just something that we believe, comprehensively addresses any issues that agency or any other body finds out, or that we feel that we need to address as well. This is something that we had planned to launch last year, it was deferred. We finally launched it in July, and its something which is very rapid. The idea is what are all the pending issues, for example, one of the sets of issues that we had was investigations. What are the actions around investigations? How is it being addressed across the company? Making sure that all sites rise to exactly that same level across. So, an overall management tool, as well.",

But Australia, Mexico and Brazil, all normalizing very fast. Europe performed particularly very well in Q2. We expect that momentum to be sustained across Europe as well as South Africa.

      "content": "Thank you, Dr. Sharma. Dear friends, welcome to Q3 FY21 earnings call. Happy to share with you a good set of numbers after quite some time. Let me walk you through the key aspects of our Q3 performance. Q3 has been a good quarter for us with sequential sales growth across all markets - highlighted by 3% QoQ growth in the India formulations business and 4% QoQ growth in the U.S. business with continuous ramp up of Albuterol. Despite the impact of weak flu season seen across various parts of the globe, weve been able to post sales growth both sequentially vis-a-vis Q2 FY21 as well as YoY vis-a-vis Q3 FY20. The operating EBITDA has also improved sequentially for the fourth quarter in a row, due to improvement in business mix and reflection of some of the cost optimization efforts on the profitability front. Talking about sales - U.S. sales grew by 4% sequentially at US$188 million in Q3 FY21, as compared to US$180 million in Q2 FY21, and grew by 1% as compared to Q3 FY20. The sequential growth was driven by ramp up in Albuterol as well as new products like Lapatinib, Tacrolimus etc. The demand for seasonal products continues to be pretty weak on back of the weakest flu season in the last decade, leading to a fall in quite a few of those products as compared to the previous year. Other in-line products however. remain stable. India region saw a growth of 5.4% YoY, since demand for acute as well as chronic products picked up as the market began to open up, leading to higher patient visits to the clinics. Despite the low contributions from COVID therapy January 29, 2021 products, we have been able to match IPM growth this quarter led by superior performance of our chronic portfolio. API sales de-grew QoQ with low volumes for some of our antibiotic APIs on account of a weaker flu season in most parts of the world. Gross margins were up by 1.4% vis-a-vis the previous quarter at 64.9%, driven by improvement in the business mix across regions and continued moderation of freight rates. We did some excellent work on the manpower cost front. Employee benefits expenses in Q3 came in at INR7,070 million as compared to INR6,850 million in Q2 on account of increments rolled out during the quarter and certain one-time restructuring costs. However, we recognize, this is quite lower as compared to the previous years. Employee benefits have come down to less than 18%, as a percentage of sales from 20% seen in FY20. We will continue efforts to improve from the current levels. On the manufacturing & other expenses front, theres a reduction, driven by lower forex losses and R&D offset by higher SG&A spend and higher royalty on partnered products. Most important line from our perspective is the EBITDA. Operating EBITDA is 18.6% excluding forex and other income. However, the top line EBITDA is 20.4%, as you would recognize. On the other operating income line, we saw the full impact of loss of MEIS export benefits for this quarter and barring the one-off income linked to litigation settlement recognized in Q3, this would have been about INR250 to 300 million on a normalized basis. To repeat again, Q3 operating EBITDA adjusted for the one-off is about 18.6%, excluding forex and other income, and this compares well with 16.8% in Q2, an increase of 1.8% as you would recognize. The ETR came down to 15.9% with all our key subsidiaries reporting profits in Q3 along with the various initiatives taken to rationalize ETR. For the full year, expect the ETR to be in the mid-30s. With this, I open the floor for discussions.",

So, for the next fiscal year, its these 3 products in the U.S. - Albuterol, Perforomist, Brovana and Fostair in Europe. In the following year, we would expect Spiriva as well as Dulera, hopefully.

      "content": "Thank you, Dr Sharma. Dear friends, welcome to our results webinar. I trust all of you are keeping well and your family members are also doing well. Its a terrible time out there. Its important that we all stay safe. Let me walk you through the key aspects of our Q4 performance. Q4 has been a challenging quarter for us, given the surge in COVID cases with the second and third wave across many geographies, and this is true for a lot of other pharma companies also. In this tough environment, the company’s Q4 sales have come down by 4% sequentially and 0.8% YoY. The US business saw 4% growth sequentially, with the continued ramp up of albuterol. This is despite the continued impact of the weak flu season. Across various parts of the globe, a weak flu season impacted our sales both sequentially as well as over the previous year. However, in spite of the headwinds on the growth of the company, we continued on the path of improved profitability. The operating EBITDA, excluding the one-time settlement income in Q3, improved sequentially for the fifth quarter in a row due to the improvement in the business mix and May 13, 2021 sustained measures on the cost front. We endeavour to drive our sales and profitability by driving the profitability mix, bringing more niche products to our portfolio and continued improvement on our cost control and optimization initiatives. Sales for Q4 were INR 3,759 crores compared to INR 3,917 crores in Q3, which is a 4% sequential decline and down by 0.8% YoY when compared to INR 3,791 crores in Q4 last year. Coming to geography-wise sales, US sales grew by 3.7% sequentially to USD 195 million in Q4 as compared to USD 188 million in Q3, and lower by 8% as compared to USD 212 million in Q4FY20. As you might recall, COVID was around the corner and there was a surge in demand in anticipation of lockdown conditions in America last year, and it was also a normal flu season last year. The sequential growth is driven by a ramp up in albuterol and other new products like posaconazole that more than offset the flu season decline QoQ. Demand for seasonal products continued to be weak on back of the weakest flu season in the last decade, leading to a USD 36 million fall in sales of oseltamivir, azithromycin and cephalosporins as compared to Q4FY20. Coming to India business, Indian branded formulations saw a growth of 6.4% YoY in Q4 as demand picked up. As per IQVIA, Lupins growth in Q4 was 5.9% vis-a-vis 8.5% for the IPM. Acute product sales have grown in Q4 versus de- growth that we had seen in Q1 and Q2 and is higher than Q3. For the full year, India branded formulations exhibited growth of 4.5% vis-a-vis the previous year. As per IQVIA, IPM growth is 4.3% compared to Lupin growth of 3.9%. API sales showed a 25.6% decline QoQ with low volumes on some of our key antibiotic APIs on account of weaker flu season in most parts of the globe. As far as EMEA and growth markets are concerned, EMEA grew by 14.6% QoQ due to strong demand in South Africa, NaMuscla and scale-up of Etanercept. Sales for growth markets is lower by 8.5% QoQ due to the second wave of COVID hitting us in several countries. On the gross margins front, Q4FY21 gross margin was 65% as compared to 64.9% in Q3FY21. This is driven by improvement in business mix in US, led by albuterol. However, on account of slowdown in seasonal products for flu season, we have had higher write-offs in this quarter. Thus, the net improvement was just 10 basis points. Over the previous year, the margin improved by 210 basis points, which is primarily on account of better mix in US and higher API margin. This is partly offset by higher freight rates and high growth in low-margin business of Brazil and Australia. Weve done a stellar job when it comes to the employee benefit expense. In Q4FY21, this is INR 640 crores as compared to INR 707 crores in the previous quarter. If you recall, it was INR 764 crores in Q4 last year. Lower expenses in Q4 is largely due to one-time savings coming in from pruning up of annualized May 13, 2021 schemes and change in policy. We, however, expect employee costs to be in the sub 18% range in spite of the increments which will kick-in in Q1. We brought it down from 22.9% in Q1FY21, which is a very good achievement. Manufacturing and other expenses in Q4 is at INR 1,118 crores as compared to INR 1,157 crore in Q3 and INR 1,152 crores in Q4FY20. The decrease of INR 34 crores YoY is driven by lower selling and promotional expenses, offset by higher royalties on partnered products. On the EBITDA front, we have reported a fifth consecutive quarter of operating EBITDA margins improvement in spite of degrowth in sales. Operating EBITDA is 18.8% excluding forex and other income for this quarter, which is 20 basis points higher than normalized EBITDA of Q3. As you recall, in Q3, whilst the top line EBITDA margins were higher, it was because of one- time settlement income. You would also appreciate that there has been continuous increase over the last five quarters, which has been a result of several initiatives that we have taken on the cost front, including procurement, routes to synthesis, renegotiating contracts, rationalization of our sales force in America and other parts and so on. We continue to strive to work on this and we will see certain improvements coming across in the future as well. We are particularly proud about our achievement on the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) front. In the course of the year, we have been working on various initiatives to optimize the overall ETR and it’s reflecting in the full year ETR numbers. Its come down from 40% last year to 26.7% for the full year in FY21. In this quarter, it is particularly low because we had over-provided in the previous quarters and weve rolled it back. It is also because of the fact that several of our subsidiaries have turned profitable, especially America; further Brazil broke even last quarter. We expect the ETR to remain at similar levels in FY22 and we will be continuously working to further optimize on this. With this short introduction, I would open the floor for discussions.",

But really strong communication going on with the agency in terms of our filing and what additional information/data they need from us. We expect to respond to that CRL later this fiscal year.

Our lead October 28, 2021 product was Etanercept, which is approved in Japan and Europe. One day it will come to the U.S. when the patent expires. Our first lead product to the U.S. is peg-G, which we filed. Its going through the review process nicely. We dont see any showstoppers right now. A key milestone is going to be a likely inspection of the facility, theres some to and fro on when that might happen. The next product is ranibizumab, which is in development. Theres a global clinical trial underway, ran slower on account of Covid, but again we hope to ramp that up going forward. There are 2 - 3 new products which are in the earlier stages of development in the pipeline as well. With the way that Lupin is able to fund this, obviously there is a constraint on how many of these projects we can finance. Vinita talked last quarter about a spinout of, one was the oncology, the second was likely the biosimilars, the third was also taking care of the specialty expense. So, weve done the specialty expense. Were on the way on the oncology spin out as well. The biosimilar spinout is certainly something that stays on the table as a discussion item. We do hope to be able to action that. I think that would free up the way for a lot more portfolio expansion, not necessarily waiting for a funding partner to tie up on a project-by-project basis and it will give a lot of latitude to development. But in the meanwhile, we cherry pick. We do 2 or 3 products at a point of time, likely 1 or 2 products in the clinic. At any point of time, we have great capability on the R&D, manufacturing, drug substance, drug product side, on the regulatory side. There is great capability to be used globally as far as biosimilar is concerned. It is going to be a good growth opportunity. But I think the financing story has to still play out.",

We have other products that we are still focused on Europe, but the opportunity is really in the U.S. We will definitely look at investments to effectively commercialize and start our biosimilars business in the U.S. effectively and really calibrate it versus the opportunity. We also have a follow-on for pegfilgrastim, the Onpro biosimilar. Were going to have both pegfilgrastim as well as the Onpro biosimilar. Theres going to be a timing gap. We will assess whether it make sense to try to club them together to be able to leverage the commercial investment or launch pegfilgrastim ahead of the on-body product. We hope that we have the opportunity to launch next fiscal year. Like Nilesh mentioned, its going to depend on the inspection. The agency has already informed us that they will have to inspect the site. Well wait for that milestone to pass and then determine the right timing to set up commercial infrastructure. October 28, 2021 Ill also say that the commercial infrastructure for biosimilars has synergies with our injectables institutional portfolio. We are simultaneously building our injectables portfolio as well, both internally through our pipeline as well as through partnerships, through in-licensing.

At this point, our base business, the U.S. generic business, complex generics, biosimilars, of what we believe a very high- October 28, 2021 growth, high-margin business in the future is a big priority for us. India is a big priority for us. Leveraging our portfolio across other geographies, the inhalation platform, the biosimilars have very strong potential across our other key geographies, Europe, Australia, Canada and the like. So, leveraging the portfolio and trying to really figure out what’s the best way we can get the full impact of our platforms across geographies is the other major area that we are investing into.",

      "content": "So, a couple of areas that were looking at. One, we have really de-risked our P&L for the womens health, right, from a commercial perspective and have partnered Solosec with a really good womens health company and Exeltis that has 120 people sales force. Thats what we had at peak, when in the first year Solosec was what tracking at $10 plus million in revenues, so were very hopeful that with the kind of strength that they bring to Solosec we will be able to do justice to the product and decent level of revenues, and profitability February 4, 2022 obviously to be shared with them, for the fact that they are putting the promotional effort behind it. So, one is that on the commercial front. Second, we have builds capabilities on the R&D front, on the technology front and IUDs, implants and rings and have three products in development right now that will continue to pursue. And they will take time because each of them is a drug device combination. Implants, rings require clinical studies. So, it takes a little bit of time. It will take two years, but we see the potential of getting these products to market, within a four-year time frame. So that is one on the womens health front. Third, we are looking at other platforms, we have our neurology product Namuscla in Europe. Were looking at the potential of bringing it into the U.S. market. Fourth, looking at respiratory, which is now become the largest part of our business in the U.S. with Albuterol and Brovana to look at areas of unmet needs where we can bring in our own products from organic R&D standpoint. And fifth, on the injectable front, where there is tremendous opportunity and the companies like Eagle and others have capitalized with the capabilities that we have now developed around injectables and peptides and colloids and long-acting injectables. We expect to bring in some innovative products. In fact, we have partnered with a company on NDA for Fosphenytoin, which is going to be our first 505(b)(2) injectable product. We expect to launch not in FY23, I think it will be tech-transferring in FY23 but in FY24. So, were looking at multiple areas and will continue to be both opportunistic as well as proactive in evolving a pipeline.",

      "content": "Now, its been four years since I last met with investors from Lupin. So I was really looking forward to meeting with you today. I hope you and your relatives, your family have been keeping safe during this time. The last couple of years have been pretty bad for a lot of families. I hope you have been doing good. Of course, I have been in touch with people about our performance. Youve been posing questions to me from time to time. And of course, we have had our regular investor calls like every quarter and you have already supported us, guided us, assisted us and we should be looking at things and so on. Thank you for that. Again, coming back to the current year performance, happy to take you through our quarterly performance as well as our results for the year itself. Its a smaller crowd out here, but Im sure there are lot of people who are on the call itself, who would potentially be asking us questions because as per the SEBI regulation, I think we need to be live for the rest of the community to interact with us. So I really would be looking forward to questions from those people who are online, so to speak. And Im happy to take this again. So, well begin with the presentation. So, this is our strategic vision. Next slide, please. Go on to the slide after that. This is our strategic vision for us as a company: a global pharma company focused on core growth platforms. As you recognize, we have done extremely well in India over time. As I listened to a lot of you, you have also been telling me that you should really be focusing on India. And just about a few minutes ago, it was very surprising because sort of people are telling me, as I was listening to them, that India is -- your valuation has been captured in India per se, and the rest of the business has not actually been valued. And to that extent, it is surprising in some ways. Im sure there are going to be a lot of questions about some of the parts and how we could take this forward, so theyre talking to me about that. And so we are looking at India very, very seriously, both organic and inorganic growth. And as weve recognized, weve done a stupendous job out here. And we just acquired recently Anglo-French because thats the way forward for a host of products in the years to come as well. As with a lot of other pharma companies, we are also acquiring assets and focusing on a lot of -- number of platforms. So a lot of complex, really complex ones. I spoke about it a few minutes ago also about the fact that we are concentrating so much on complex injectables, on our inhalations portfolio. And let me add biosimilars. And the fact that OSD business is not going to be the focus area. And thats resonated with you as well. From a global perspective, we believe that we need to be absolutely focused on efficiency. There are number of initiatives that we are taking to make ourselves a lot more efficient because there has been tremendous inefficiencies that have crept into the system over the last few years. But we are conscious of that, and were taking all steps to kind of work on that. May 19, 2022 We are also building operating leverage in our CapEx spend, as well as on R&D. Of course, the overall focus would be to really focus on product development cycles for development and to kind of compress that so that we are delivering top-notch launches from time to time. So, it actually helps in leveraging our top line, a continuous improvement culture, sentient culture, if you may. And of course, the global quality class. All of these, of course, are initiatives that weve taken and were really going to focus on. You would like to add to that, Vinita, if you may?",

As youve seen in the last year, weve pretty much taken the specialty burn off in the organization. Likewise, we have efforts underway to take areas like chemical entity where, again, we have established tremendous capability, but it does not really give us operating leverage in our current business, does not get valued in our current business, so finding the right path for those platforms are all efforts that are underway to really focus on these 3 core pillars of growth for the organization, which is doubling down in India, delivering on our complex generics platform and globalizing our complex generics platform. When you look at our platforms like inhalation products, like biosimilars, like complex injectables, unlike the oral solid dosage business, these are global platforms. With the investment that were making both in the pipeline and as well as with building capacities, it may cost us possibly ourselves so that we can, from an economic standpoint, get the end-to- end benefit.",

      "content": "Yes. Thank you. These are the other markets that we are present in. So, essentially, weve made some good progress across various markets. On the EU5, for example, we also -- Fostair was introduced, and we have been ramping up on NaMuscla as well. Australia, we made this acquisition, Southern Cross, which we believe would serve us good in the years to come. South Africa, now the fourth largest generics player, and of course, been a market leader in cardiovascular space for quite some time. Brazil -- so thats been a loss-making unit until very recently, but its turning around pretty nicely for us. Mexico, we are market leader in ophthalmology, number two actually, Sophia is number one. But in terms of values and then in developing a national footprint, we really are going the full hog out there. And of course, API business -- our fortunes have dipped this year essentially because of acute therapy products not selling in most parts. But I understand the JV business continues to do pretty well. Some headwinds in India on the TB front, but overall, still good growth. And as you might know, we are looking at getting kind of broad-basing our overall portfolio of products that we serve for the global institutional business. Next slide, please. The P&L, essentially, this is a snapshot. This was actually provided previously. We spoke about the fact that there has been a slight decline in overall sales. And we also spoke about the reason why there was a decline in overall EBITDA margins. And there are, of course, exceptional items from a write-off perspective also. This time around, we had accelerated amortization of certain intangibles in Gavis, which we took this year. And overall, given the fact that we actually had a huge exceptional items in Q3. We had -- we ended up with the entire year at an overall loss situation. But just to add, that the next two quarters could potentially be -- might have the same lackluster feeling. But the second half of next year onwards, you would actually see a step up in terms of sales, as well as in terms of the margins that go with it. As Vinita was saying, there are a number of products that we are looking at for America over the next several years. And for sure, I think this would begin in Q3 with Suprep and thats something which we already have an approval for. This is again a snapshot of what we spoke May 19, 2022 about. Essentially, the annualization of our annual results for the year, for the company. And I guess its something that we just spoke about in terms of the exceptional items, making this a very exceptional year in some ways. Next slide, please. Yes. R&D, as you can see, its been running steady at around INR350 crores, INR375 crores mark, so to speak, and now its around the 8% mark. But more importantly, the character of R&D is shifting. As Vinita was also saying, it is going to be more -- a lot more focus on complex generics, so its going to be inhalations and the injectables and biologics all the way -- biosimilars all the way. And of course, the salience of NCE would certainly come down over time. Theres been a tight rein on overall capital expenditure. As you can see, we used to -- it used to be in the INR1,800 crores range. Its hovering around the INR600 crores mark, but theres a lot of impetuses on reining in the CapEx cost expenditure outlays. And of course, from being a cash surplus company, there is a slight increase in overall debts. Theres tremendous scope for potentially working on working capital optimization. Its around 145 days currently, and we and my team are working on optimizing on that. It turned out to be a debt situationally because the fact that we had to pay up the settlements related to Glumetza, but that is one- time. Its a question of time if we kind of get back into the surplus situation until we actually start using it for productive purposes, including M&A. And thats something that we are saying, youll be looking at in India and worthwhile acquisitions in other parts also. Next slide, please. Really, your slide, Vinita. If you want to talk about complex generics, youre passionate about it.",

      "content": "So -- again, this is continuing on the same theme. We have already started monetizing our inhalation platform with products like albuterol that we have monetized in the US. Now a solid product for us. And some of these platforms, as you can see from the flags that we put in there are geographic. We have the potential of leveraging across multiple geographies. So, on the inhalation front, we also launched Fostair recently as said in U.K. and have plans to launch other inhalation products in U.K. and Europe as well, as well as China. So, the inhalation platform has started and in the next couple of years will really become a material part of our business, as well as geographical spread. I mean right now, we have albuterol, but looking at the next 12 months, Spiriva and then Dulera and Fostair. We have Qvar, the next wave of DPIs, MDIs, the Ellipta products, the Respimat products, all in the development on the inhalation front. On the biosimilars front, again, multiple geographies that we are addressing. And the focus has shifted from, of course, our first program, pegfilgrastim, for the US, which were looking forward to bringing to market soon, the products where we can be in the first phase, where we are in first or second to launch and have the potential of really getting major upside as well as a strong long-term position. On the injectables front, after inhalation and biosimilars in fiscal year 24, we will see material launches coming through. Weve had a number of complex filings. This past year, we have had our first peptide filing on the products like ganirelix, products like glucagon, our Risperdal Consta on the depot front, thats pretty far along. We hope to be the first company to file a 505(j) for Risperdal Consta and so on and so forth. So, material pipeline, complex product pipeline on the injectables front. On the womens health front, weve made significant progress on the drug device combinations. Products like Nexplanon and Mirena, weve already got proof-of-concept and have put these products into the clinic. Again, from a timing perspective, its inhalation now, biosimilars next, injectables soon thereafter and womens health in the 4-year to five-year time frame. Next slide, please.",

Mylan continues to launch in multiple countries, and we expect our share to build over the next 12 months to 24 months with Etanercept. The U.S. is still long away, still 2029. But needless to say, we have reserved rights of the product for the U.S. market. Pegfilgrastim, while we are a late entrant on Pegfilgrastim, really, for us, we will start learning the market through it. And hope that in the next 12 months, we get inspected by the FDA and well plan to launch the product. Were very pleased with our position actually on the on-body Onpro product, where we seem to be one of three and potentially in the first wave. Our customers are very, very keen to see us in the market with that product. So, we think we will really grow pegfilgrastim materially with the launch of Onpro, which is 10 months behind the pre-filled syringe but its going to be a material anchor for us on the biologics front. Lucentis is well under -- when we had some delays in the clinical trial with Covid, but now its well underway. And again, very strong partnership position in the U.S. that weve already established for Lucentis. Well share more as we come closer to the opportunity. And right after that is Eylea. So, on the ophthalmic front, both Lucentis and Eylea are going to be material opportunities for us that we would leverage through the channels that we have established relationships with. And then we have programs earlier stage in the pipeline that we are pursuing.",

I mean like Etanercept, we had that R&D cost sharing with Yoshindo. Likewise, on other programs, we have got financial investment and upside sharing. So, in a way, some of those programs, youre going to look at all of it as an upside, if the program is being funded by a partner. So, in terms of the revenue split right now, I mean, obviously, its all Etanercept and its small. And its going to be all ex U.S. right now. In the next year, as we launch pegfilgrastim, well see a material shift to the US. And as we have ranibizumab as well, I mean, if I look at ranibizumab, its 50-50 between the U.S. and Europe in terms of market opportunity, but we have a bigger opportunity in the U.S., just given that the customer -- the channels are very similar to the folks that we have established relationships with; the ophthalmic, specialty channel, for example, through our wholesaler relationships is what we will be able to leverage for a product like ranibizumab or a product like Eylea.

And one -- so we wanted to change ourselves like in Somerset, Nilesh mentioned, the Head of Operations was a position that we changed and brought in someone very solid from Teva to lead the site at the manufacturing level. And on the quality front as well, we felt -- there we had a turnover and then we brought in a person from the outside. And continuity becomes a problem when you have that kind of churn. So, we have faced it. At the same time, weve always tried to scale up when weve had turnover. And now when I look at some of our G&A functions in the US, I mean, when you look at finance, for example, HR, IT, all of them have turned over. But we have, again, scaled up. We brought in capabilities that have helped us clean up a lot of our baggage from the past. For example, the FTS cleanup that you have seen in the year, unfortunately, it hits the P&L now, but as a cleanup that should have happened over the last couple of years. Likewise, the May 19, 2022 processes that the team are now very, very strong going forward for the organization. So in the last year, weve also focused a lot on really putting in contemporary processes. We found that some of our basic processes for supply chain, which is crucial for a generic business were challenged. They were antiquated, to be honest. They were set 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and we had a need to really revisit them so that we can really be better in terms of predicting what our next six months, next 12 months, next 24 months looks like and take proactive decisions to get out of product or to manage the failure to supply penalties in a strategic manner. And we have done that. We implemented IBP in the company this past year for the U.S. Right now, we are doing it ex U.S. for all of the developed markets and then the rest of the company. So, we are -- we have taken the time in the last 12 months to really set in very, very strong processes. So, of course, at the end of the day, leadership and people drive the success, but processes are equally important for a company to scale up.",

As you know, he was the Head of U.S. Generics, Biosimilars and Global R&D. For personal reasons, he has decided to leave the organization for the opportunities. And we have taken this as an opportunity to get closer to the business, both Nilesh and myself. We have a very strong Head of Commercial in the U.S., who started the U.S. business, who will lead the P&L from a U.S. perspective. We felt the need and had already started a search for a Chief Scientific Officer for organization with a number of platforms that we have. Our biggest unleash for the organization is our pipeline delivery and platform performance, for which we identify the need of a very strong Chief Scientific Officer. So, we have a search ongoing for it. We have an Interim Head of R&D, Interim CSO, our Head of Portfolio and Pipeline. Sofia Mumtaz is our Interim Chief Scientific Officer. And weve also created a very high-powered -- not high powered, in terms of level in terms of leadership, but a very strong project management office that reports into Nilesh and myself to map and to track all products from product selection to development, to filing and launch to ensure that we get the most out of our R&D investment. So multiple changes there on the -- related to the U.S. business that I felt was -- would be good to share with you.",

But as we transition to out of the legacy OSD business, which we think is actually on a weaker footing at this stage in America on to more complex generics, you would expect the margin profile, the realizations to be much better, the margin profile to increase. We are also stepping out of August 4, 2022 our OAI status across the plants, so to the extent our ability to come out of the products is certainly going to be much better. We have invested ahead of the curve when it comes to a lot of factories and the like and we are doing what it takes to kind of rationalize on the workforce front, on the footprint front and the like. There is, of course, over the last couple of years, last few years, I would say, weve been building up a culture of cost consciousness, including digital roadmap. All of this will actually come to bear fruit. And there is of course progress across various other geographies. We have Luforbec, better products in UK, Europe. We have NaMuscula. Things are looking much better in other geographies as well. So I think its a combined impact of all of this which will actually improve the profile for us. India is continuing to do strongly whilst of course in America, we just enumerated the various products that we could bring to the market and so on.

I mean, last year it was $200 million in revenues at 18% EBITDA. And it grows double-digit year- on-year. I mean, the only place where we are still trying to really get it to the right level of profitability is Brazil, but the other countries are all pretty high margin countries. And while they are growing organically and have a very rich pipeline, we are looking at small bolt-ons into the emerging markets to be able to grow it beyond the 15%, 20% level in the next four to five years to get to between $400 million to $500 million in revenues. And there is tremendous potential in Latin America itself beyond Mexico, Brazil. And also in Africa, I mean, we have started the efforts of getting from South Africa to Sub-Saharan Africa. We have started registering the products to be able to grow into the region. So, certainly have plans to really grow our emerging market business. Likewise, we are truly under indexed in Europe. I mean, if you look at most of our peers and you look at also the global generic companies, they typically have a much larger presence in Europe. Were probably one of the smallest. And we have significant potential there as well. In particular, now with the complex generics with inhalation products, with the injectables coming, we have tremendous potential there to grow the business. So continue to look at small bolt-ons to be able to effectively commercialize our products in Europe as well.",

      "content": "Hi, everyone. This is Vinita Gupta here. A very warm welcome to our Q2 earnings call. I have with me our Managing Director, Nilesh, as well as our CFO, Ramesh and members of our Finance and Investor Relations teams. Trust you all have seen our numbers for the quarter, and Ramesh will share a deeper analysis of our performance. As you would have noted, our business has improved. Revenue growth was driven by the bounce back of our U.S. business along with continued growth in our India business, and also growth across all other geographies. On the margin front, we see the benefit of our optimization measures in addition to the revenue growth in the business. We are focused on sustaining this positive momentum for the rest of the year. I would like to share some of the business highlights with you. On the U.S. front, we have continued to evolve our business with optimization of oral solids, driving growth of complex generics, respiratory franchise, in particular and executing on our new product launches. During the quarter, our respiratory franchise contribution increased, and we executed on a couple of new product launches in particular Suprep that will help growth in Q3 and Q4. It had some contribution in Q2, but since it was launched in September, more to come in Q3 and Q4. In addition, we closed our acquisition of the Sunovion brands, Brovana and Xopenex that will enable us to enhance our respiratory position in the U.S., while contributing to revenue as well as profitability growth. As we look at the quarters ahead, we have new product launches like Spiriva, Diazepam Gel, Nascobal Nasal Spray and Darunavir, multiple products where we have exclusivity or first-to-market position that will enable us to grow our U.S. business in a profitable manner. On Spiriva, while we had hoped to get an approval by now, we are close. We have responded to all the queries the agency had raised and are working closely with the FDA to get approval by our eligible launch date. We will know more in the next few weeks, and well share what we learn with all of you. In any case, we see this as a substantial contributor for fiscal year 24 and will definitely have a significant runway based on the competitive position at present. November 10, 2022 Switching to India, the largest part of our business, while our growth in the quarter and the first half has been below market, this is primarily due to the loss of Cidmus from our cardiovascular portfolio and generalisation in the gliptins. But for the diabetes portfolio, our India business grew ahead of the market. Also, the diabetes franchise, while impacted in the near term, we expect growth in the mid- to long term given the continued growth in diagnosis and increased affordability with generics coming to the market, and our own generics. In our top therapy areas, respiratory and cardiac growth was in line with the market and therapeutic areas that we are trying to build like GI and womens health were well above the market. We expect the second half of the year to be better than H1 from a growth perspective and are committed to get our India business back to double-digit growth in the quarters and years to come. All other markets continued to grow and perform as per expectations, in particular, we saw a really strong local currency growth in Mexico and strong double-digit growth across Australia, Germany, Canada and U.K., our other developed markets. On the margin front, we have seen significant efforts that we have had underway in the last 12 to 18 months’ payoff, our margins did improve, and we expect to see this benefit continue in the quarters to come despite inflationary pressures. A word on the compliance front, we have made progress this past year with the clearance of Goa and Somerset warning letters and successful inspection of Ankleshwar and Nagpur. However, the warning letter at Tarapur certainly was disappointing for us. We have clarified with the agency that it is only specific products that we have discontinued over the last couple of years from the site and we continue to manufacture a number of key products with a clear commitment to meet the FDAs concerns on nitrosamine and cross-contamination that they highlighted to us during the inspection and in the warning letter. Overall, we are moving in the right direction, as you can see from what we have delivered in the quarter and are really committed to grow both revenues and profitability in the quarters to come, while executing on our strategic plan. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

Year-on year basis, it was about 2.2% as compared to Q2 FY 22 sales of INR 4,003 crores. I would just go on to the margins a bit. FY 23 Q2 gross margin was 58.1% as compared to Q1 of 55.3%. This is mainly due to one-time shelf stock adjustment in the previous quarter, and in this quarter, we also November 10, 2022 had optimization of freight costs, both mix and rate and other write-offs and better product mix as well. There was, of course, some price erosion, which was well contained though. On the employee benefit bit, Q2 FY 23 is INR 771 crores vis-a-vis INR 778 crores in the previous quarter. Manufacturing expenses, very well contained again, FY 23 was INR 1,226 crores vis-a-vis INR 1,191 crores in line with the sales development itself. EBITDA, operating EBITDA, excluding FX and other income, is 10.6% in Q2 FY 23. Quarter-on-quarter growth in EBITDA is about 610 basis points, which is led by expansion of gross margins over Q1 and higher sales growth, which is again reported across various regions. R&D is flat as compared to Q2 FY 22 at 8.3%. ETR, normalized ETR is expected to be between 31% and 34% as few subsidiaries like LI, LOI, Digital and Healthcare continue to make losses. Operating working capital days improved to about 140 days in Q2, visa-vis 147 days in Q1 of FY 23, a reduction in inventory despite delivering higher sales. And with this, may I open the floor for discussions.",

There are several initiatives that we have been carrying on, and also we have been focusing on gross margins apart from what we are doing on the top line front itself and as we looked on alternate vendor development in terms of routes to synthesis etcetera for the gross margins bit. In terms of the manpower itself, yes, we did go through, in fact, with the workforce planning at the factory level. There was a reduction, and youll find a lot more coming up in Q3 and Q4 as well. I think there is a shift between lines, essentially thats the reason why youre actually found it to be a little flattish when it comes to the manpower lines itself, but believe me that there has been overall reduction, which has come through. On the SG&A front, there is a lot more of sales promotion in line with the overall sales development itself, and thats across various regions, including India. But despite all of that, you would see that the overall margins have November 10, 2022 actually gone up, and so thats in line with the development of the gross margins front as well as the evolution on the sales front.",

Its only the presence of in fact some loss making subsidiaries in various parts that is actually causing this number to deteriorate. And the first quarter, of course, there was this anomaly, because of lower sales in America caused because of the stock situation being what a buzz. But we are very much conscious of this and for the full year actually you would see it going down for the year end, and the fourth quarter, for example, it could be very much in line with normal rates. In the next 2 to 3 years, we expect the tax rates to come down for sure, for sure in India, but we also expect profitability to come back to in a lot of other regions, so that could potentially bring down the overall effective tax rate for the company.",

      "content": "Sure. Just 1 more question on the, lets say, the India business, which has been kind of, lets say, sub-par in terms of growth. That is one. And the other emerging market and ROW market in the Europe and all those are kind of doing relatively better in terms of growth. So on this market, how do you see that, okay, when you are expecting there is a profitable progress for your company as a whole, the role of these market and your aspirations in these markets and your strategy. So, in what manner these markets are going to contribute to your profit and progress of Lupin? Vinita D. Gupta: So, I think we talked a little bit about it. But when you look at other emerging markets, its roughly 11% of our revenues. You look at the other developed markets, roughly 10% of our revenues, both growing extremely well. The emerging markets, whether its Latin America, South Africa, Philippines, grew double-digit and its a profitable business at an EBITDA margin well above the company average, and we continue to drive growth in the emerging markets, look at opportunities opportunistically again, look at what we can help grow them faster. But are looking to find ways and means of growing their emerging markets, other emerging markets of the entire pie. Likewise, the developed markets are roughly 10% of our revenues, and thats Canada, Australia and Europe. Out of which Australia is the largest now. I mean done extremely well. I think that region probably was the fastest growth part of our business in this first quarter. And one, because we had the integration of Southern Cross in Australia. Two, we had products like Fostair growing the U.K. business and the like. And our Canadian German business also performed pretty well. I mean, the developed markets, I think, really have really good growth drivers that have a synergy with our U.S. market. So, when you look at the inhalation pipeline, when you look at the complex injectables pipeline, when you look at our biosimilars pipeline, theres significant potential in all developed markets. So, our inhalation plans are global, especially for the developed markets, its material opportunity. Likewise, the injectables and biosimilars. So, we expect the other developed markets to grow very nicely in the years to come as we evolve our pipeline and bring these complex platforms effectively to market.",

      "content": "Hi Everyone. This is Vinita here. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q4 FY23 earnings call. I have with me our MD, Nilesh, as well as our CFO, Ramesh. Were very pleased to close the fiscal year with continued improvement in operating margins. Our team has had a sharp focus on getting our India business back to double digit growth and quarter after quarter improvement in US margins as well this focus along with growth in other areas like API, EMEA and APAC enabled us to deliver margin improvement as planned. We are committed to sustaining this positive momentum into the new fiscal year and driving strong growth across all our regions in particular: India, based on our recent salesforce expansion; and the US aided by material new product launches. Our India business as you would have noted recorded an 11% plus growth per IQVIA, ex the diabetes portfolio growth was 15% plus, in line with the market growth. In Q4, we made a significant investment to expand our sales force in India and enhance our reach. Were very pleased that overall we delivered margin improvement for the organization despite this material investment. In the US we improved our margins for a third quarter in a row through portfolio optimization, maximizing the high value products and continued cost optimization efforts. We were able to improve our margins despite increase in R&D spends quarter over quarter. Overall, when you look at it for the year, the R&D spend for the US was $100 million with an increasing proportion of complex generics in particular inhalation and injectables. Apart from India getting to double digit growth and U.S. business improvement, our API business recovered in the quarter with demand growth in our core products. Our EMEA business grew driven by South Africa quarter over quarter and Fostair (Luforbec) in Europe year over year. In APAC, our Philippines subsidiary performed very well. Switching to R&D, we continue to drive the shift to complex genetics with a focus on respiratory and injectable products. We filed 19 products in the US and 10 ex-US. Of the US filings, we had four injectables, 3 nasal sprays and we made progress on Respimat and Ellipta products on both platforms. Apart from generics, on the R&D front, we optimized the New Chemical Entity (NCE) R&D spent in Q3 to focus on only two of our oncology pipeline programs, significantly reducing the discovery spend. Switching to compliance, weve made progress in part with positive outcomes on the Ankleshwar, Vizag, Nagpur injectables and Somerset sites. Weve also May 10, 2023 made substantial progress on our remediation efforts in Tarapur, Mandideep Unit 1 and Pithampur Unit 2. We are committed to ensure that we get all our sites to a consistent and sustainable level of compliance. Im sure well see more progress on this front in fiscal year 2024. On the M&A front, our recent acquisitions have performed well with Anglo French; Southern Cross; Xopenex, Brovana in the US and Paloma in Brazil, all delivering as per plan. Our recent acquisition of Medisol in France enables us to accelerate our injectables franchise in Europe. We are very pleased to be able to close that. We have come a long way in fiscal year 2023 and I am excited about the prospects in fiscal year 24 as we launch products like Tiotropium, Darunavir and others in the US and drive consistent double-digit growth in our India business. We remain focused on driving operating margin improvement as we grow our business. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, welcome to a refreshing set of numbers. We are hopeful that it sets a stage for better numbers here on. Sales for Q4FY23 are at 4,330 crores as compared to 4,245 crores in Q3FY23, which is a growth of 2% quarter on quarter. On a yearly basis, the company registered at 12% growth over Q4FY22 sales. In the US, during the quarter, we registered a small degrowth of 1.3% in local currency terms. On a sequential basis, the sales have come down from $177 million to $175 million. During the quarter, Albuterol sales came down marginally due to a seasonal impact. In India region, India branded formulations business declined by 3.1% in Q4 FY23 versus Q3 FY23, whilst on a year-on-year basis the sales grew by 8.9%. For full year FY23 year on year the growth was 3.3%. Overall market growth during Q4FY23 was 14.9% whilst Lupin grew by 11.3%. Lupin which has highest growth in Q4 as compared to the earlier quarters, Q1 was 1%, Q2 was 6.2% and Q3 was 7.5%. Adjusted for diabetes, we were close to market growth rates, at 15.2%. Due to loss of exclusivity and geneticization, the anti-diabetes business has impacted our growth rate as patented portfolio is a large chunk of our diabetes portfolio. We have also done well excluding the top three areas of Lupin, also in gynaecology and GI. API business sales grew by 14.6% on quarter-on-quarter basis. As core Cephalosporin API sales continued the path to recovery from higher sales in Cefaclor and 7-ACCA; On a year-on-year basis sales growth was 46.4%. EMEA sales for the region grew quarter on quarter by 19.3%, year on year the growth was 11.4%. For South Africa, quarter on quarter growth of 35.3% in local currency terms led by higher sales in various products. For UK, the year- on-year degrowth was 6% but the higher sales over the last quarter is primarily driven by Fostair. For Germany, quarter on quarter degrowth was 12%: Q3 was higher for Germany due to competition stock outs. May 10, 2023 For Growth Markets, sales grew by 4.7% quarter on quarter driven by Philippines. Traditionally, Q4 is a strong quarter for Philippines. Nearly all divisions perform well in comparison to the last year charting a growth number of 14%. For Australia, quarter and quarter and year on your growth was led by higher sales and acquired portfolio of Southern Cross. For Australia, Q3 was lower due to shipments getting deferred to Q4. For Grin, quarter on quarter degrowth was 23.6% led by stock out of certain products due to plant shutdown. For Brazil, quarter on quarter growth of 9.4% was led by the by acquired products from Paloma. On gross margins, Q4 FY23 gross margins is 59.7% as compared to Q3FY22 gross margins at 59.8%. The sales mix especially India regions played a part in the slight lowering of the gross margins. Since the beginning of this year, we spoke about optimization initiatives on various fronts. Im glad to state that we did achieve good progress on some elements of the program as in the case of sales returns, air freight and so on, both elements of which get folded into this line. Secular inflation of over 5% in input prices has however eroded into the gains which were marking visible progress here. We continue to work on write offs and other initiatives including launch of meaningful products that would further make a difference in the gross margins and hence to the bottom line. The employee benefits line in Q4FY23 is 773 crores vs 764 crores in Q3FY23 and 703 crores in Q4FY22. Quarter on quarter increases mainly due to field force expansion in in the India region, higher bonus accruals, ESOPs in US etcetera. On an ongoing basis, we expect employee cost be around 19%. Despite the lower growth on the top line, the year-on-year increase has been only 3%, reflecting the initiatives on the workforce reduction that we carried on at various functions. This also captures a negative impact of FX translation resulting from a depreciating rupee. On manufacturing other expenses, Q4FY23 is 1,303 crores vis-à-vis 1,333 crores in Q3FY23 and 1,321 crores in Q4FY22. Quarter on Quarter savings is a result of reduction in business settlements and other expenses of a one-time nature. Year on year, savings is on account of reclassification done in in travel in Q4 last year from employee benefits. Friends, whilst there are savings as a result of optimization measures, the translation impact of outside India expenses, as well as an increase in sales promotion spends in India along with and minor investments in adjacencies businesses offsets the gains made. Operating EBITDA excluding Forex and other income at 13.9% for the current quarter, reflecting an improvement of 170 basis points in comparison to the previous quarter. The improvement of EBITDA is primarily driven by optimization endeavours, lowered other expenses and PLI benefits. With May 10, 2023 launch of newer products and sharper focus on cost, we expect material continued optimization of EBITDA across quarters over the next year. R&D expenses are 7% of sales at 350 crores in the current quarter as compared to 289 crores thats 6.8% of sales in Q3FY23 and 8.9% in Q4FY22. We continue to pivot to more complex products and platforms while continued to focus on costs and outcomes. Year to date, ETR was 36.9% and for the quarter, the ETR was only 5.9%. The lower ETR in the current quarter was mainly due to higher profit in the US apart from normalization of accounting for the effective tax rate. Other operating income, Quarter on quarter, there is an increase in other operating income on account of inclusion of PLI benefits, somewhat reduced by other settlement income, other milestones and the like. Forex gains is at about 26 crores in Q4 FY23, Q3FY23 was 16.6 crores. So that I would like to open the field for discussions.",

So with the cache of products that were launching across various markets and you would see the top line lifting up to double digit growth rates for the entire year. And, of course with the tight leash on costs, you would expect the better margins also to go up. We do think that towards the end of May 10, 2023 this current fiscal, you would find a substantial increase closer to impact where we think we should be a part of 18% plus percent",

      "content": "Yes. So your two-part question on the injectables, the first Medisol just gives us access to France. You know France is a market where we’ve had very little exposure right now in Europe. We’re really in Germany, UK directly and then France, with NaMuscla. But this small, toehold, so to say just gives us entry into the hospitals in France. And it allows us to really take our injectable pipeline that we have put in place for the US as well as other developed May 10, 2023 markets and bring it into France. The hospital segment in the France is actually pretty attractive, for the portfolio that we have invested in. So, it gives us an access point. It doesnt give us material infrastructure or a sales force. It really gives us access to the market and its a very accretive deal. Its a small asset, but accretive, which our focus has been on all our acquisitions to really buy accretive assets that dont dilute our earnings. So on the, contribution from injectables, Id say that FY25 onwards, I mean so we have been building a pipeline. We have a good number of products filed even in FY23 we filed Liraglutide, we filed Glucagon and the Caplin products were filed. So, well see six or so injectable products coming to market in FY24. There will be these smaller products, and the larger products, whether its Glucagon or Risperdal Consta, we expect in FY25. So that will be our hopefully a big ramp up year for injectables. And then we are trying to figure out ways and means that we can accelerate that with products that we can partner, products that we can acquire. The US generics team is actively working on it to figure out how we can accelerate the injectable build.",

For example, the 6th division that were going to launch is an extra urban division where we will go to doctors and geography that we dont even cover at this point of time. So I dont think it is competition with each other. Definitely when you launch products, obviously you compete against other companies, but I dont think its that and I dont think its going to have a reflection on pricing. There is an opportunity in the bigger scheme of things, I think its the GDP, the amount of spend on healthcare out of GDP, affordability, the ability for people to pay, to get diagnosed and tested, that is the bigger story in India. And I think anybody whos really focused on India is driven towards that story, certainly we are. So, I dont see this as a limiting opportunity going forward.

      "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, folks. I am very pleased to welcome you to our Q1 FY24 earnings call. I have with me our MD Nilesh as well as our CFO Ramesh. We look forward to sharing our Q1 highlights and outlook for the fiscal year. We are very pleased to start the new fiscal year strong with continued momentum across our major regions, improving compliance position, multiple new product approvals and improvement in operating margins. Our India business is firmly back to double digit growth and the US business margin has continued to improve. We expect to see material improvement in the rest of this fiscal year as we launch Tiotropium and other new products in the US as well as our sales force expansion in India starts yielding expected productivity from Q2 onwards. Our India business recorded an 11.5% growth QoQ and 10.2% growth YOY and this is after the NLEM impact as well as CIDMUS brand that we had in the base last year. Cardiology and Respiratory TA’s grew better than market growth, our Diabetes TA that has been a challenge for the last many quarters due to loss of exclusivity of key in-licensed brands is now back to growth as planned by our team. As we look at Q2 and beyond, based on the momentum we have and the enhanced productivity from the sales force expansion, we now feel confident of consistent above market growth. Switching to the US, our margins continued to improve for the fourth quarter in a row on the strength of a stable base business, continued performance of key products like Albuterol, Lisinopril and Suprep, launch of Darunavir where we had exclusivity on the 800 mg strength. In addition to revenue growth and better product mix and therefore better gross margins, we also continued to deliver on reducing SG&A as well as distribution cost. With the approvals of products like Tiotropium, Cyanocobalamin, Diazepam gel and other approvals now likely due to Pithampur Unit 2 Warning Letter clearance, we have a rich August 4, 2023 pipeline of products to drive revenue and margin growth in the US for the rest of this fiscal year and beyond. Apart from India and the US, all other regions performed well too in particular our Institutional TB and API business did extremely well during the quarter. On the R&D front, our spend increased QoQ, driven by patent litigation on key products, Ranibizumab clinical trial and long-acting Risperidone completion. On the NCE front, we were very pleased to receive the milestone from Abbvie for our program advancing into the clinic. Our pipeline is now positioned well to evolve our business into complex generics with inhalation MDI and DPI, injectables from Nagpur and partnered products, as well as complex ophthalmic products from Pithampur Unit-2. On the compliance front we have made progress with positive outcomes with Pithampur Unit-2 warning letter clearance that will enable us to launch Ophthalmic products filed from the site in particular products like Prolensa where we were first to file as well as other ophthalmic products next year. that will enable us to launch important products like PROLENSA, where we are first to file, as well as other ophthalmic products next year. Out of the five sites we had under warning letter, we have now cleared three and continue to make progress on our remediation efforts in Tarapur and Mandideep. We are committed to ensure that we will get all our sites to a consistent and sustainable level of compliance. We are excited to start fiscal year 24 on a strong note and look forward to executing on our new product launches, continued momentum in India, and operating margin improvement as we grow our business in the year. We expect fiscal year 24 to be strong with quarter-after-quarter improvement in revenues and profitability. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, welcome to a refreshing set of numbers. On the last occasion that we met, we did promise you that our results and margins would get to be better in successive quarters. We have endeavoured to live up to that guidance. August 4, 2023 Sales for Q1 FY24 came in at INR 4,742 crores as compared to INR 4,330 crores in Q4 FY23, a growth of 9.5% QoQ. On a YoY basis, the company registered a growth of 31.6% over Q1 FY23 sales of INR 3,604 crores. The sales of Q1 FY24 included $25 mn income from Abbvie for key milestone of initiation of Phase 1 clinical trials. Excluding the same our sales were 4,537 crores which represented a growth of 4.8% QOQ and 25.9% YOY. Our sales growth this quarter has been robust across all our key geographies. The US market registered a growth of 3.6% QOQ and 49% YOY (in local currency terms) whilst the India branded business registered a growth of 11.5% QOQ and 10.2% YOY. The API business registered growth of 4.5% YOY and 32.1% QOQ. During the quarter, the US business registered a growth of 3.6% (in USD terms) on QoQ basis as sales went up to $ 180.7mn from $ 174.5mn in the previous quarter. In Q1 FY’23 the sales were only $ 121.3mn. Products like Darunavir, Suprep contributed to this robust performance. We are continuing to maximizing the high value products resulting in a sustainable and profitable US business. India Branded Formulations business sales improved by 11.5% QOQ and against previous year the sales improved by 10.2%. Our growth excluding Cidmus and NLEM is a robust 13.60%. API business sales grew by 4.5% on QoQ basis due to higher 7ACCA sales as core cephalosporin API sales recovered handsomely. Similarly, on YoY basis sales growth was at 32.1% led by higher sales thanks to good demand pick up in the cephalosporin API. Q1 FY24 gross margin is at 65.4% and at 63.8% ex NCE income, as compared to Q4 FY23 gross margins of 59.6.% (a Variance of about 6.8%). The improvement in margins quarter on quarter is driven by US as well as India. In the US, we had NPL launches, better mix, higher price realization in few products and reduction in freight expenses. The margins also expanded due to higher better mix both in IRF and API apart from other reasons. We do expect this margin to sustain We have improved significantly from last year Q1, when our gross margin was 55.3% to the current levels of 63.8%. The improvement, again, was driven in US margin as Q1 margin last year in US was at all-time low. Improvement in India and API margins are also the other major contributors to the overall margin improvement year on year August 4, 2023 Q1FY24 is at INR 853 crores which translates to approximately 18.5% of adjusted sales vs INR 773 crores in Q4FY23 which translates to approximately 18% of sales. The same was INR 779 crores or 24% of sales in Q1FY23. The QoQ increase is mainly due to annual increments which were to the tune of 7.5% across the globe. Q1FY24 manufacturing and other expenses came in at INR 1,472 crores vs INR 1,303 crores in Q4FY23. These expenses were reported at INR 1,192 crores in Q1FY23. The QoQ Increase is on account of higher spends in R&D, increased consultancy charges for nitrosamine related impurities, increase in selling and promotion expenses in India due to field force expansion. Same reasons were also responsible for the year on year increase. R&D is at INR 368 crores (7.8 % of sales) in Q1 FY24 as compared to 1,280 crores in full year FY23 which was 7.9% of sales. The increase in R&D QOQ is on account of investment in newer platforms of biosimilars and injectables. Our EBITDA came in at INR 879 crores in absolute terms, representing an 18.5% margin. Excluding one-time NCE income, Forex and other income, our EBITDA margin was at 14.4% or 651 crores, reflecting an improvement of 50 bps in comparison to the previous quarter. The improvement in EBIDTA is primarily driven by higher gross margin, partially offset by higher expenditure in R&D, higher employee cost due to salary hikes and higher PLI income in base quarter. The Effective Tax Rate was 18.9% in Q1 against FY’23 ETR FY’23 of 36.9%. The lower ETR is primarily on account of US subsidiary which has seen a turnaround, offsetting the NOLs of prior year, and the ETR was also lower on part of Sikkim tax benefits. The ETR for the full year is expected to remain between 21%-22%. Operating working capital was at INR 5,195 crore as on June 30, 2023 which translates into 103 operating days. This has reduced from 119 days at March 31, 2023. Net Debt as on June 30, 2023 stands at INR 1,310 crores which has come down from 2,500 crores at the end of Q4FY23. We have done repayment of packing August 4, 2023 credit loans in India and also retired some debt in Australia. With this, we could open the floor for discussions.",

      "content": "Yes. So out of Indore, in particular, the ophthalmic products, we see a nice opportunity around in five or six products that we have filed from the site. Some of them were just pending because of facility, which now should happen. Like PROLENSA is the first of the pipeline opportunities that really is an upside for us this fiscal year. The other, we have products like Brimonidine, products like Prednisone, like five or six products that are meaningful out of the ophthalmic facility, and in particular now with the shortages in the marketplace on the ophthalmic front, we see a nice opportunity for these products. We should have PROLENSA this year. And we think that three or four products are going to be next year, next fiscal year. To your second question on the evolution of a pipeline into complex generics, on the inhalation front, of course, MDIs and now with Spiriva, DPI, nicely expanding our portfolio franchise. And we are actively working on other DPI platforms, Ellipta in particular, we have made significant progress. We hope to report at the end of this fiscal year, a material milestone on that front, on one of our products. On Respimat also, we have made significant progress, and well make more so in the next fiscal year. But Ellipta, we have made significant August 4, 2023 progress so far. On the MDI front, there are a couple of products that we are pursuing. And then we are actively also taking a look at the whole move towards Green Propellants in the U.S. and Europe, and working on both the current product of 505 (j) to the current product, as well as the novel propellant versions of the MDIs, that can enable us to potentially have some differentiation and exclusivity in the marketplace. So, Id say that strong progress on the DPI front and Respimat, and some progress on the MDI front, especially given the Green Propellant move, we are watching that carefully, so that we dont have to - we make an investment and have to redo a product completely. So, thats on the inhalation front. On the injectables front, as I mentioned earlier, we are adding to our pipeline very actively right now. We have multiple 505 (j) products and 505 (b) (2) products that we have added to our pipeline already. Nine products in active pipeline this year have been added to the injectable pipeline. And apart from that, Id say, I think back on the respiratory front, we also have nasal sprays that we are actively working upon. And lastly, Id say, on the implants and devices, we have made good progress on products like Nexplanon and Mirena, where we have developed equivalent versions of the products and are actively working on the clinic right now.",

As far as diagnosis is concerned, were already starting to see some synergies with the core prescription business. Digital, again, feeds into our expertise in the Cardiac space, and it is an extended offering from that front. If you want to do a meaningful play into CDMO, then yes, that would be a different play compared to the other stuff that we would do, but we obviously have capabilities for doing that. No, I think as far as the core business model is concerned, we are extremely upbeat on India. Were extremely upbeat on the complex generic story in the U.S. At some point of time, we want to build out the innovation piece all over again. The emerging markets have always been double digit growth markets for us, with pretty much better than company average EBITDA. So, I think the core focus remains on the business as is, weve got plenty to do in this space. Vibha R: Okay. Thank you.",

I have with me our MD Nilesh, our CFO Ramesh and our head of Investor Relations Ravi. We look forward to sharing our Q2 highlights and outlook for the Fiscal year. We are very pleased to build on the momentum over the last couple of quarters and deliver significant improvement in operating margins driven by growth across majority of our regions, US launch of Tiotropium and continued focus on efficiencies. Our US business delivered continued growth in revenues and margins for a 5th quarter in a row on the strength of a stable base business, launch of Tiotropium and overall strong performance on respiratory products. In the quarter, respiratory products contributed 45%+ of our revenues. We expect to sustain our business at $200mn plus level now going forward with the continued ramp up of Tiotropium and other NPLs in H2 and beyond. Our India business recorded growth inline with the market, with better than market performance in key therapeutic areas Cardiology, Respiratory, GI and Women’s health that we are building. Diabetes TA which was in a de-growth mode is back to growth, and will continue to build on it in the quarters to come. As we look at the second half, we expect that the investments we made in expanding on sales force to get to a level of productivity that will help us build on our growth rate from the first half. We already started seeing gains in the start of Q3, October has been strong and we expect to continue that in the rest of Q3 and Q4 for our India business. Apart from US and India, other regions performed well too. In particular Europe recorded strong growth due to ramp up of generic gFostair in our direct markets like UK and Germany as well as through partners in other parts of EU. November 9, 2023 On the R&D and pipeline front we have continued to build on the momentum with both material FTF and complex generics. We were very pleased to get key product approvals like generic gTolvaptan and generic gXywav in October that will drive big part of growth in next couple of years, in particular gTolvaptan. Our pipeline is now positioned well to evolve our business into complex generics with Inhalation, Injectables and complex Ophthalmic products given the Pithampur Unit 2 clearance. On the compliance front we have continued to make progress and are committed to ensure that we get all our sites to a consistent and sustainable level of compliance. With the strong focus on delivering the pipeline coupled with compliance gains, we can now see a clear path to sustainable growth over the next few years for our business. We are delighted to deliver strong performance in the first half of this fiscal year and look forward to executing on our New Product Launches, continued momentum in India & other markets with a strong focus on sustaining and improving our operating margins in the second half. With this I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

Should I assume the 35% to 40% is the fair share that you were talking about and, capacity is not an issue, therefore youve given that number? Vinita D. Gupta: Yes, we have built capacity not only for the U.S., but also for our other markets. So, in the next 6 to 12-months, we expect to launch in Australia, Canada, Europe, multiple regions that we built capacity for. So we are well-positioned.",

Any color on, the kind of scale up which has come through and where, where are these from profitability perspective and contribution to our overall profitability as we go forward? Vinita D. Gupta: Certainly. I mean, apart from the U.S., when we think about, apart from U.S. and India, Europe has been a very strong contributor this fiscal year so far, and we expect that to continue over the next couple of years. Likewise, Australia, Canada, all of them had a pretty strong run rate over, over the last couple of quarters driven by complex generics. I mean, if you look at Europe, Fostair generic has become our largest product there, and were continuing to ramp it up. So, respiratory has become a big part of the focus in Europe. In Canada as well, were looking forward to launching Tiotropium soon. Australia as well, we expect to launch Tiotropium soon. I believe, we are under- indexed right now in the ex-U.S. developed markets. Our complex generic portfolio inhalation, also biosimilars and injectables really will enable us to grow these markets as well. So, they become a larger part of the company over the next two to five years.",

On the profitability front, we have come a long way over the last year and a half, still a long way to go. Our highs of 20 margins certainly are aspirational for us. Right now, we can see a path over the next few years to get to a good 20% plus. Mid 20s is our goal, to really close the gap with our peers. There’s no reason why we should be below that. But as we continue to look at the company prospects beyond five years and look at investment plans in particular in areas like specialty, which long-term are our aspiration for our organization. Well have to determine what kind of investments we make. So, wed hope to get to 20% plus, then the mid-20s and then well determine whats the best way to grow our organization for the long-term.",

      "content": "Good evening, everyone. Im very pleased to welcome all of you to our Q3 Earnings Call. I have with me our MD, Nilesh; our CFO, Ramesh; and our Head of IR, Ravi. We look forward to sharing our Q3 highlights and outlook for the fiscal year. Were very pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong performance. Continuing to build on the momentum over the last many quarters, we delivered our highest quarterly sales so far, crossing the INR 5,000 crore mark. What is very heartening is that all our major regions have performed. Not only have we seen revenues grow across our key segments, but we also achieved higher profitability both at the gross and operating level. Our US business delivered a second consecutive quarter of $200 plus mn revenues and a sixth straight quarter of EBITDA improvement, which was very heartening. This has been aided by volume-led growth in our base business, augmented by contribution from seasonal products and our Respiratory portfolio including Tiotropium. As mentioned in our earlier interaction, we expect to sustain our US business at the $200 plus mn levels in the next few quarters as we get into the next year with a continued ramp- up of Tiotropium and launch of new products, including multiple ophthalmic and complex injectable range. Our India business recorded strong double-digit growth this quarter with 1.6 times IPM growth rate. Most of our therapeutic areas like Respiratory, GI, Gynaecology have outperformed IPM during the quarter. We have launched around 21 products in the year so far and per IQVIA, we are ranked number one in new product launches in India. We have a strong chronic focus as you know, with more than 60% of our sales contribution from chronic therapies. We believe that we are in a very good position now to deliver above-market growth consistently going ahead led by higher productivity from our sales force expansion, new divisions, and enhanced penetration and reach. February 8, 2023 Apart from the US and India, other regions have performed very well too. Ex- US and India, our Formulations business has grown 30% YoY during the quarter and 22% in the nine months during the fiscal led by strong growth recorded in key markets like Canada, Philippines, Australia, and South Africa and also a very strong ramp-up of generic Fostair in our direct markets UK, Germany as well as through partners in the Rest of Europe. Switching to R&D. On the pipeline front, we have continued to build momentum with both material First-to-Files and complex generics. We received 14 ANDA approvals during this quarter, including key product approvals like generic Tolvaptan and Ganirelix, which is our first peptide injectable product. We also launched Bromfenac Ophthalmic Solution, the generic version of Prolensa, thanks to our Pithampur Unit 2 facility approval. And as you know, we have six-month exclusivity on this product. Out of Somerset, we launched Diazepam Rectal Gel, which has also been an extremely nice launch for us. In terms of key filings, in the last quarter, we filed Risperdal Consta product out of Nanomi, which is a significant validation of the platform as well as strong complex injectable product filings for us. So as I mentioned before, our R&D is evolving to more complex products, especially on the inhalation and complex injectables front, which augurs well for the sustainable growth of our business going ahead. Compliance is our number one priority and we are fully committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world that we serve. We have completed remediation efforts at Tarapur and Mandideep Unit 1 and are confident that we will get these sites cleared as we have done with the others in the near future. We are delighted to have delivered on our promise of sustained and profitable growth during this year. We feel confident that our strategic focus on R&D, patient centricity on the brand front, and continued cost business optimization sets us on a path of sustainable growth going forward. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance. February 8, 2023",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, I welcome you all to our Q3FY24 Earnings Call. Im happy to report that this quarter we have delivered the highest top line number in our history, and after many quarters for the first time we have surpassed the 20% plus mark on the EBITDA front as well. Diving into the numbers. Sales for Q3FY24 came in at INR 5,080 crores as compared to INR 4,245 crores in Q3 last year, a growth of 19.7% YoY. On a QoQ basis, the company reported growth of 2.8% as compared to Q2 of FY24. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. North America has grown at a strong 24% year-on-year. India business has grown at a healthy 13.4% YoY whereas EMEA grew at 36% YoY. Our ROW grew 72% and Growth Markets grew at 13% YoY. US Business During the quarter, the US business recorded a sales of $212 mn, staying steady at Q2 levels in constant currency. This has been due to volume share increase in base products. Inhalation products this quarter is around 40% of US sales. India Branded Formulations Coming to India, the India business has grown 13.4% YoY. The prescription business has grown 12.9% YoY during the quarter and 10% during 9MFY24, handsomely outperforming the IPM growth during the period. Also, if we exclude the impact of the in-licensed products, even our diabetes portfolio has grown at 2x the TA growth during the quarter. The share of in-licensed products today has been reduced to 10.4% of our portfolio from around 15% to 16% last year, and this has a positive impact on our profitability. EMEA Our EMEA region, which constitutes our EU region and South Africa business, continues its outperformance during this quarter as well with strong growth of 36% YoY. Growth in EU has been driven by partnered business and our inhalation business going strong. Our South African business has also grown a strong 21% in local currency YoY. February 8, 2023 Other Operating Income The Other operating income has increased by 51.4% this quarter and this is essentially coming in from enhanced PLI benefits. Gross margins Coming to profitability, Q3FY24 gross margins were 66%, up from 59.8% in Q3 last year and 65.5% in Q2. This improvement was driven by multiple factors which includes product mix, lower share of in-licensed products and increased volumes. Employee Benefits Expenses Employee benefits expense at INR 890 crores, increasing by INR 125 crores as compared to Q3 last year and translating into 17.5% of sales vis-à-vis 18% last year. I would like to mention that this increase is mainly driven by the annual salary hikes and the India field force expansion which we undertook last year in Q4. Manufacturing & Other Expenses Q3FY24 manufacturing and other expenses came in at INR 1,560 crores, which translates to approximately 30.7% of sales as compared to 31.5% in Q3 last year. On an absolute basis, costs have remained flat QoQ. Whilst there has been a marginal reduction in the R&D expenses on account of phasing, the higher volume demand led to higher manufacturing costs during this quarter. R&D R&D is INR 357 crores, which is about 7% of the sales in Q3FY24 as compared to INR 290 crores at 6.8% in Q3FY23. For the full year, however, we expect it to be in the region of INR 1,500 - 1,550 crores EBITDA In the quarter, as you see, we have made improvements across all lines. Our gross margins are higher. There has been increase in the operating income and the higher sales ensured higher operating leverage as well. Subsequently, February 8, 2023 this has resulted in driving the EBITDA margins considerably higher. Excluding forex and other income, EBITDA was INR 1,022 crores, up by 98% YoY. Margins for the quarter were significantly higher at 20.1% versus 18.7% in Q2FY24, and 12.2% in Q3 last year. For the nine months period, the EBITDA margins excluding NCE income are at 17.8%. ETR And so far as the tax is concerned, our ETR was 15.8% in Q3 and 18.6% for the 9MFY24. For the full year, we expect it to be around 20%. Balance Sheet Moving on to the balance sheet. Operating working capital was at INR 5,419 crore as on 31st December which translates into 96 days of net working capital. This is reduced from 135 days as of 31st December 2022. Our net debt stands at INR 1,043 crores, which has been reduced from INR 2,527 crores at the end of March 2023, indicating reduction of INR ~1,500 crores during the 9 months period. We believe that we will be debt free by the year end. ESG Our DJSI Index scores have been reassessed pretty recently, resulting in an overall score of 69 for Lupin in the S&P ESG Assessment 2023. This increase from our initial communication underlines a continued effort to excel in sustainable performance, positioning us above the global average. Our latest Carbon Disclosure Project scores are in and they speak volumes about the progress we have made in our sustainability journey. Over the last two years, our diligent efforts and collective commitment have elevated our Climate Change disclosure from C to B in the Carbon Disclosure Project. This surpasses both the Asia regional average and the biotech pharma sector average, reflecting steady determination to mitigate climate risks and embrace sustainable practice across all our operations With this, may I open the floor for discussions?

And there has been secular growth in other markets as well. But you would also recognize that while theres a lot of room for optimism, there are certain dark clouds on the horizon also in terms of the Red Sea disturbances, air freight going up and the like as well. So several moving parts. Having said all of that, the fact of the matter is our EBITDA margins are still lower than the competition and we would like to get to the 22.5%, 23% range. But given all of this, the moving parts, we would like to state that it should be between the 19.5% to 20.5%. But clearly, the pathway is to get to the 22%, 23% as early as possible.",

I mean, today, Respiratory is over 25% of the companys global revenues. When you look at both the India business as well as the US, Europe, Canada, all of the different markets that we have, and we have significant capabilities there. So certainly, Respiratory is one where we believe that we have the right to play and look at opportunities to both organically as well as inorganically to build our portfolio. If you have other opportunities like Xopenex, we will certainly look at them seriously. The other area that we like, based on our foray in Europe: Neurology with NaMuscla, the orphan product that we have. In Europe, we have successfully launched it in multiple countries there. And we’ve started the study for a broader indication for the product, even though itll still be an orphan indication and looking to really expand that portfolio with other CNS neurology assets. So those two are certainly areas that we are looking at programmatically and then others opportunistically. February 8, 2023 Likewise, were looking at our therapy areas in India and the TAs where we want to build a stronger position for the future. We are strategically looking at opportunities to buy brands and portfolios.",

I have with me our MD, Nilesh; our CFO, Ramesh; and our Head of Investor Relations, Ravi. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as the full-year and outlook for fiscal year 25. We are very pleased to close the year on a strong note, continuing to improve our operating margins and maintain the business momentum for the last many quarters. Revenues in the quarter have grown 13% year-over-year driven by all major regions, in particular, U.S., India, EMEA and APAC. Gross margins and operating margins improved in Q4, based on better business and product mix, in particular in the U.S. and also higher efficiencies. We were very pleased that EBITDA margins improved quarter over quarter, despite higher R&D investments and Q4 seasonality impact in U.S. and India. Our U.S. business continues strong at $200 million plus revenues, despite lower seasonal products and reduction in products like Darunavir that experienced additional competition. Our base business performed well, and new products like Tiotropium and generic Prolensa helped offset the seasonal product decline. We are at a good level with 30% substitution with Tiotropium, 10 months into the launch. We expect Tiotropium to continue to be a major growth driver in fiscal year 25. We had 6 product launches in the US during the quarter with Prolensa Ophthalmic, Ganirelix Inj and Cyanocobalamin being the meaningful ones. February 8, 2023 We expect to sustain our U.S. business at the $200 million plus level, going ahead with the continued ramp-up of Tiotropium and new product launches in fiscal year 25. We have 10 plus launches during the year. Our India business has grown 8.3% year-over-year in the quarter, and 9.6% for fiscal year 24. Within this, our India prescription business has grown 8.7% year-over-year and ex-Cidmus 9.3% year-over-year on full year basis, this was 1.2 times IPM growth. Core therapies like cardio and respiratory segments have grown well ahead of the market and we are very confident of continued 25-30% over IPM in fiscal year FY’25. We have already started to see this in April. We have also carved out our trade-generics business into a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary to enhance agility and drive focus on this high- growth segment. Apart from the U.S. and India, other regions have performed well too. EMEA and APAC recorded strong double-digit growth in the quarter, driven by Fostair generic in Europe and strong growth in markets like Australia as well as Philippines. We complemented our global respiratory portfolio by acquiring two accretive established brands from Sanofi for Europe and Canada. During the year, we also closed our Medisol transaction, the French complex injectable company, which expands our position in complex generics, in particular in Europe. On the R&D front, we have continued to pivot to more complex products, in particular inhalation and complex injectables. We spend around 50% of our R&D investments in these two platforms. Complex products today constitute around 40% of our US portfolio which we expect to increase to about 50% to 60% in the next few years. In the fiscal year 2024, more than 80% of our new product revenues in the U.S. were from non-oral solid products. This augurs well for sustainable growth of our generic business going forward. Switching to compliance, we have continued to build on our momentum with recent inspections at Aurangabad and Dabhasa with positive outcomes. We February 8, 2023 are on track with our remediation efforts at our Tarapur and Mandideep Unit 1 sites and are fully committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with best-in-class GMP standards. Reflecting on the year gone by, fiscal year 2024 has truly been an inflection point for our organization. We are very pleased to turn around our business and deliver on our promise of sustained and profitable growth, driving the shift to complex generics, getting our India business growth to 20% to 30% above market, improving our GMP compliance position and continuing to drive efficiencies. It has also been a year of growth across all our regions and business segments. As we look at FY’25 and beyond we are focused on continuing to drive margin improvement while growing and evolving our business, building on our portfolio evolution into complex generics and specialty. We are truly excited with the potential we have ahead of us. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

Weve registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. North America has grown at a strong 23% year-on-year. India business has grown February 8, 2023 at a healthy 8.3% year-on-year, whilst EMEA grew at 17% year-on-year. Our ROW grew 8% year-on-year and growth markets grew at 16% year-on-year. On a full-year basis, sales have come in at INR 19,656 crores, a growth of 21% year on-year and 20% year-on-year adjusting for NCE income received during Q1 ofFY24. All key segments, excluding LATAM have delivered strong growth. In particular, U.S. grew 29% in constant currency terms. Our formulation business excluding India and US has grown robust 20% YoY during this period. U.S. business During the quarter the US business recorded sales of $209 mn marginally lower than Q3 levels on constant currency basis. While pricing on base business has remained relatively flat, the decline has been due to lower volumes on seasonal products and lower sales of products like Darunavir. For the full year, the U.S. Business has recorded sales of $850 million as against $632 million last year, registering a growth of 29% year-on-year in constant currency terms. This has been led by volume growth in our base business and healthy contributions from new products. As Vinita mentioned, our strategy of focusing on complex products in our pipeline has paid handsome dividends, and more than 80% of the sales from our new products this year have come from non-oral solids. In fact, if you look at our pipeline for FY25, more than 70% of the new launches in the current year will be non-oral solid in nature. India region The India business has grown by 8.3% year-on-year in the quarter and 9.6% year-on-year in FY24. Specifically, during the year, the prescription business has grown 8.7% year-on-year and 9.3% ex-Cidmus, outperforming the IPM growth during the year. Segments like respiratory, cardiology, and oncology have outperformed IPM growth in their respective segments. The share of in-licensed products in the February 8, 2023 quarter has reduced to around 11% of our portfolio from around 15% to 16% last year, while also having a positive impact on our profitability going ahead. Weve launched 28 products in FY24 and plan to launch about 20 products in FY25. Im also happy to report that our diagnostic business is scaling up very well, with revenue growth of 160% year-on-year and around 40 labs under operation. EMEA Our EMEA region, which constitutes our EU business and the South Africa business, registered strong growth of 17% year-on-year during the quarter, and 24% year-on-year in FY24. This has been driven by steady growth in key EU markets like UK and Germany, NaMuscla, inhalation products and also partner business. Growth markets Our growth market includes the APAC and LATAM regions. The APAC markets grew by 33% year-on-year during the quarter, led by strong growth in markets like Philippines and Australia. LATAM markets however, declined by 6% year-on-year in the quarter, due to ongoing headwinds in Brazil, which were partially offset by growth in Mexico. Other operating income Other operating income at INR 66 crores has decreased by 34% year-on-year, during the quarter. This decrease is primarily on account of the phasing of PLI benefits during the year. On a full year basis, other operating income came in at INR 355 crores against INR 372 crores last year. Gross margins Coming to the profitability, Q4 FY24 gross margins were 67.8%, up from 59.6% in Q4 last year and 66% recorded in Q3FY24. Whilst we have seen improvement driven by multiple factors, which includes better product mix, lower share of in-licensed products, increased volumes, February 8, 2023 and gross margins have also benefited from higher inventory, which we are carrying on account of risk mitigation measure due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. For the full year, reported gross margins have come in at 66.2% as compared to 58.3% last year. Adjusted for NCE income, gross margins are at 65.8%. Employee benefit expenses at INR 900 crores increased marginally from INR 889 crores in Q3FY24, translating into 18.4% of sales vis-a-vis 17.5% last quarter. This change is largely attributable to higher impact of ESOPs, offset by lower seasonal domestic sales during the quarter. For the full year, employee costs have increased by INR 407 crores, mainly driven by the annual salary hikes and the India field force expansion, which we undertook last year. This translates to 17.8% of sales on a reported basis, and 18% on adjusted basis as compared to 19% of sales in FY23. Manufacturing and other expenses Q4FY24 manufacturing and other expenses came in at INR 1,490 crores, which translates to approximately 30.4% of sales as compared to 30.7% of sales in Q3 this year. The expenses are lower in spite of higher R&D, due to lower business settlement expenses, lower litigation costs, lower SG&A costs due to seasonality. Manufacturing other expenses in FY24, came in at INR 6,073 crores, an increase of INR 1,019 crores as compared to FY23. This translated to 30.9% on a reported basis and 31.2% of sales on an ex-NCE basis as compared to 31.1% last year. This has been led by primarily higher R&D outlay, higher SG&A on account of field force expansion and higher volumes from increased sales. R&D is at INR 426 crores, thats 8.7% of sales in Q4FY24, as compared to INR 305 crores at 7% of sales in Q4FY23. For the full year, R&D is INR 1,527 crores, vis-a-vis guidance of about INR 1,500 crores to INR 1,550 crores, translating to 7.8% of sales. February 8, 2023 EBITDA Excluding Forex and other income, EBITDA was at INR 997 crores, up 65% year-on-year. Margins for the quarter were higher at 20.4%, vis-a-vis 20.1% in Q3FY 24 and 13.9% in Q4 last year. For the FY24 period, reported EBITDA margins at 19.3% and excluding NCE income at 18.5%. Depreciation & Amortization Depreciation and amortization at INR 457 crores as compared to INR 264 crores last year. This recognizes impairment of INR 201 crores relating to the intangible assets, which are essentially discontinued ANDAs, and certain tangible assets. ETR ETR was 26% in Q4 and 20.1% for FY24. Balance Sheet Items Operating working capital was at INR 5,691 crores as of 31 March, 24, which translates to 105 days of net working capital. While this has been a reduction as compared to the last year, its increased from the 96 days recorded last quarter, primarily on account of higher inventory that we are carrying, given the disruption and the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Net debt stands at INR 477 crores. Its reduced from INR 2,527 crores in March 23, indicating a reduction of more than INR 2,000 crores during the year. ESG On the ESG front, of course, weve done extremely well, as youll be aware, and we have got a S&P DJSI score of 69 over 100, kind of reflecting exceptional performance, placing us at the top 95 percentile for the pharmaceutical sector as a whole. With this, we will open the floor for discussions. February 8, 2023",

South Africa business has been a really good scale, but had got under a lot of pressure with the currency issues there, and the fact that majority of the portfolio is imported into the country. That has turned around in the last couple of quarters, and the business has started growing very nicely as well. So, South Africa is in a pretty good position, both from a growth as well as EBITDA standpoint. In Latin America, both Mexico and Brazil. Mexico actually, we had a significant challenge last year with a facility being closed down for 10 months, which actually caused a lot of disruption in product supply. We were back to the market and with the ramp up of our portfolio. We have seen a really good resurgence of our business. So we expect fiscal year 25 to be really strong for us in Mexico. Brazil continues to be a bit of a challenge for us, and we are looking to find ways and means of, improving that business, but that continues to be a low margin business for us.",

      "content": "Good afternoon, friends. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q1 fiscal year 25 earnings call. I have with me our MD - Nilesh and our CFO - Ramesh. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as outlook for the year ahead. We are very pleased to start the new fiscal year on a strong note with solid double digit growth in revenues and margins both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis. EBITDA margins at 23.3% have expanded by 290 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong commercial execution on new product launches as well as in line products, continuous attention to operational improvements as well as lower than anticipated R&D spend. In parallel, we have continued to improve our position on the quality and compliance front, having received positive FDA inspection outcomes for our Aurangabad, Somerset, Nagpur and Dabhasa facilities in the last quarter. Our US business had a great start with strong growth sequentially and year- over-year driven by more stable in-line business, strong contribution from respiratory products both Tiotropium as well as Albuterol and new product launches like Mirabegron and Doxycycline that more than offset decline in products like Suprep® that have seen additional competition. As we look at the quarters ahead, with continued ramp up of the new products that we have launched, additional new product launches like Pred- Forte® that we just received with CGT, Glucagon later in the fiscal year, Liposomal Doxorubicin that were in the midst of launching at present, we expect to grow our US business at a high single-digit in fiscal year 25. Also, August 7, 2024 our US business has returned to a strong level of margins given the shift to complex generics and strong focus on driving productivity and efficiencies in the base business. Switching to India, we recorded 10.5% growth versus IPM growth of 8.7%, which was 21% ahead of the market. Cardiac, Respiratory, GI and Vitamins business in India grew well ahead of market. Our internal diabetes portfolio, non-licensed diabetes portfolio that is, grew at 2 times the category growth during the quarter, which was very heartening for us. We also successfully completed the carve out of our trade generics business in India to 100% own subsidiary with the objective of achieving agility, better focus and growth of this business going ahead. From a new product launch perspective, we have been at the forefront in terms of NPLs in India and have a healthy pipeline of around 20 products which we plan to launch in the fiscal year. We are confident that our reach through our 10,000 plus reps along with our portfolio enhancements will enable us to grow around 20% to 30% higher than the market in the year ahead as we have guided in our earlier interactions. Switching to other markets, our other developed markets grew a strong double-digit, driven by Canada due to Zaxine® - our brand business there, and new product launches like Spiriva® and Etanercept, UK due to Luforbec® and new product launches in Germany and Australia. Our other Emerging markets also grew double digits driven by Mexico, Philippines and South Africa. On the R&D front, while Q1 has been light, we expect our spent to ramp up in Q2 and Q3 with the progress that we have in our pipeline. We expect R&D to be around INR 1,800 crores for fiscal year 25, with an increasing percentage of complex generics as we have planned over the last couple of years. We look forward to a very solid fiscal year 25 ahead with the momentum we have built in all our regions, the new product pipeline engine delivering at high gear and continued focus on the fundamentals from a efficiency and compliance standpoint. Our strategic growth drivers provide us with a clear line of sight to growth beyond the current fiscal year, both in terms of top line and EBITDA going ahead. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance. August 7, 2024",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, I welcome you all to our Q1 FY25 earnings call. The highlight of this quarter has been a strong operating performance in all our key segments, both in terms of sales and profitability which have led us to report a 23% plus EBITDA margins for the quarter. Diving into the numbers, sales for Q1 FY25 came in at INR 5,513 crores as compared to INR 4,742 crores in Q1 last year, a growth of 16% year-on-year. However, if you exclude the USD 25 million of NCE income received last year in Q1, our sales have grown at 22% year-on-year during the quarter. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. North America has grown at a strong 28% year-on-year. India business has grown at a healthy 18% year-on-year, whereas EMEA grew at 26% year-on-year. Our Growth markets grew at 27% year-on-year and API business has grown 7% year-on-year. US business During the quarter, the US business recorded sales of USD 227 million, a growth of 25% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter on a constant currency basis. This growth has been led by new launches offset by single- digit price erosion in base products and additional generic competition in certain products like Suprep®. Our strategy to pivot to more complex products is paying off handsomely and we have now had eight consecutive quarters of EBITDA improvement in this business. We have clear strategy to deliver consistent growth in business going ahead. India region Coming to India, the India business has grown by almost 18% year-on year during the quarter. The prescription business has grown 10.5% year-on-year, outperforming IPM growth by around 1.2x during the quarter. Segments like Respiratory, Cardiology, GI and the Multivitamins have outperformed IPM growth in their respective segments. The share of in-licensed products in the quarter is at 14% as compared to 15% last year, which also has a positive impact on our profitability. We have launched 28 products in FY24 and plan to launch around 20 products in FY25. Other businesses August 7, 2024 Revenue in our ex-India, ex-US formulations business which includes EMEA, RoW and Growth markets have increased 22% year-on-year to INR 1,185 crores and now constitutes around 21% of our sales. EMEA Our EMEA region which constitutes the EU region and South Africa business, registered strong growth at 26% year-on-year during the quarter. This has been driven by healthy growth in key markets like the UK and Germany from Luforbec® and NaMuscla® amongst others. Growth markets Our growth markets include APAC and LATAM region and theyve grown at 27% year-on-year during the period. The APAC market grew by 26% year-on- year during the quarter led by strong growth in markets like Philippines and Australia. LATAM market grew 28% year-on-year in this quarter due to strong growth witnessed in Mexico. Profit/Loss Speaking about the P&L, other operating income is at INR 86 crores which has increased 20% year-on-year during the quarter. This increase is mainly due to higher PLI and export benefits during the quarter. Gross margins Coming to the profitability, Q1 FY25 gross margins were at 68.4%, up from 67.8% in Q4 and 63.8% ex-NCE income recorded in Q1 last year. This improvement is driven by multiple factors which includes better product mix, lower sales of in-licensed products, increased volumes, and also cost improvements and efficiencies, which we have undertaken over the last several quarters. Barring any unforeseen situations like geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the like, we feel confident of maintaining gross margins around these levels going ahead. August 7, 2024 Employee benefits Expenses came in at INR 971 crores, increasing 15% year-on-year from INR 844 crores in Q1 FY24, translating to 17.6% of sales vis-a-vis 18.6% last year. This change is largely attributable to higher costs in terms of business growth as well as increments during this period. Manufacturing and other expenses Came in at INR 1,598 crores which translates to approximately 29% of business as compared to 32.5% of sales in Q1 last year, reflecting a growth of 8.6%. The expense in absolute terms is higher due to legal and professional fees and of course, higher volumes and the like. This of course has been offset by lower R&D figures. Research & Development R&D is at INR 350 crores, 6.3% of sales in Q1 FY25 as compared to INR 426 crores which was 8.7% of sales in Q4 last year. Our full year R&D is expected to be around INR 1,800 crores. EBITDA In the quarter as you see, we have made significant improvements across all lines. Our gross margins are higher. There has been increase in operating income and the higher sales ensured higher operating leverage as well. Consequently, this has resulted in driving the EBITDA margins considerably higher. Excluding forex and other income, EBITDA was INR 1,286 crores, and increased by 50% year-on-year. If we exclude the NCE income we received in Q1 last year, EBITDA is almost double on a comparable basis. Margins for the quarter were higher at 23.3% vis-a-vis 20.4% in Q4 FY24 and 14.4% ex-NCE income which were recorded in Q1 last year. Tax August 7, 2024 So far as the tax is concerned, our ETR is 18.8% during the quarter. For the full year, we expect ETR to be around 20%. Balance Sheet On the balance sheet items, we have been focusing on operating working capital and there has been tremendous improvement there, as you can see, given the fact that the net operating working days is just about 100 days as against 105 days in the previous quarter.

      "content": "Good evening everyone. I hope all of you had a great Diwali. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q2 fiscal year 25 earnings call. I have with me our MD, Nilesh, our CFO, Ramesh and our Head of Investor Relations, Ravi here. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as outlook for the year ahead. We are very happy to report another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, led by strong commercial execution in our key markets and also backed by new product launches. We are in particular pleased with our EBITDA performance with 510 basis points improvement year-over-year and 50 basis points improvement sequentially, despite higher investments in R&D. We feel confident of maintaining our growth momentum in the coming quarters with EBITDA margins in the 22% to 23% range for the fiscal, based on our business momentum and continued focus on driving efficiencies. Our US Business performance was strong this quarter with volume-led growth in in-line products, and strong performance in our respiratory portfolio, offsetting additional competition in products like Suprep® and Doxycycline. With the recent successful launch of Mirabegron 50 milligram, and Pred Forte® with the CGT exclusivity, we feel confident of delivering close to double-digit growth in the US this fiscal. Also we have continued to improve our profitability in the US, led by better product mix and higher efficiencies in the base business. We are very optimistic of our long-term growth strategy in the US. So far, we have evolved our business to 40% complex generics, and we have an exciting pipeline with more than 20 respiratory products, and 40 injectable products in development that we believe will enable us to continue to drive the shift to 50% plus in the next couple of years. Coming to India, we reported strong growth of 19% year-over-year led by growth in our India formulations business and additional tenders in our Global November 8, 2024 Institutional Business. Our India Formulations business recorded growth of 10.9%, 40% ahead of the market. For H1, our growth was 30% ahead of the market, so very strong momentum in India. Volume growth in the quarter was a strong 3.5%. Im happy to report that all our key therapy areas Cardiac, Respiratory, Diabetes and GI grew ahead of the market. I would like to specifically call out our Diabetes portfolio which was challenged in the past due to loss of exclusivities on brands. Our Diabetes business now, grew 19% year-over-year against the category growth of 9% in the quarter. We feel confident on continuing to deliver above market growth in our India Formulations business backed by a strong portfolio of innovative and in-licensed products, and extensive reach through our 10,000 people sales force. Our non-US developed markets grew 20% year-over-year driven by strong growth in key markets like Canada, UK and Australia. Growth was contributed by both in-line products like Zaxine® in Canada, Luforbec® our Fostair® generic in the UK, as well as new product launches. We also witnessed healthy growth in our key Emerging markets like Mexico and South Africa during the quarter. On R&D, as planned, R&D as a percentage of sales has increased to 8.2% during the quarter. We successfully completed Phase 3 for our Ranibizumab biosimilar this quarter which paves the way for us to file the product in the US and EU this year. We expect R&D to be around INR 1,800 crores for fiscal year 25 with an increasing percentage of complex generics as planned, primarily in the respiratory as well as injectables platforms. From a compliance perspective, we have submitted our responses to the recent FDA audits at our Pune Biotech and Pithampur Unit-I facilities. We would like to reiterate that we are committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with US FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world. Before I hand it over to Ramesh, I would like to say that we remain very optimistic on our growth potential both in the short and medium term. Our strategic growth levers are well defined and backed by an exciting pipeline of products in our chosen markets and key therapy areas. We are committed to driving efficiency measures while leveraging our investments across all major geographies. We are confident on building on our momentum both in terms of top-line and profitability going ahead. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. Friends, I welcome you all to our Q2 FY25 earnings call. I am happy to announce that we have delivered another quarter of consistent double digit revenue growth across most of our geographies. We have also November 8, 2024 increased our EBITDA margins despite an almost 190bps QoQ increase in our R&D spend. Diving into the numbers. Sales Sales for Q2 FY25 came in at INR 5,497 crores as compared to INR 4,939 crores in Q2 last year, a growth of 11.3% YoY. On H1 basis, sales came in at INR 11,011 crores vs INR 9,681 crores last year, growth of 13.7% YoY. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. India business has grown 19% YoY, North America has grown 6% YoY, EMEA grew 20% YoY, Growth markets grew by 12% YoY whilst API grew 10% YoY. The US Business In the quarter the US business recorded sales of USD 220 mn, a growth of 3% YoY on constant currency basis. As Vinita mentioned, volume growth in our base products, and increased sales of respiratory products were offset by increased competition in products like Suprep® and Doxycycline and low single digit price declines. We also had impact of high channel inventory for some of our new product launches which will get normalized going ahead. Based on our visibility of new product launches like Mirabegron 50mg and Pred Forte® amongst others, we are confident of meeting our guidance of close to double digit revenue growth in the US for this fiscal. We also continue to execute on our strategy to improve our profitability in this segment, with another quarter of high profitability from this business. On a long-term basis, we remain confident of consistent delivery of profitable growth through an increasing share of complex products in our portfolio. India Region Coming to India, the India business grew by 18.8% year-on-year during the quarter. With this, the prescription business has grown 10.9% year-on-year, outperforming IPM growth by 1.4x during the quarter. Even on H1 basis, the prescription business has grown at 10.8%, handsomely outperforming IPM by 1.3x. Our chronic segment has grown 13.5% year-on- year during the quarter, against an IPM growth of 9.7%. If you look at our top three segments of Cardiology, Diabetes and Respiratory, we have handsomely outperformed their individual category growths within the IPM. I would also like to mention that as per IQVIA, Lupin is ranked number three in so far as new product introductions are concerned. The share of in-licensed products is around 12% as compared to 15% last year, which also has a positive impact on our profitability going ahead. November 8, 2024 I would like to mention that in our India region, outside the India prescription business, our adjacencies and domestic part of our Global Institutional Business have also performed well in this quarter, with revenues of INR 208 crores versus INR 66 crores in Q2 last year. In so far as other businesses, revenues in our ex-India, ex-North America formulations business which includes EMEA, ROW and Growth markets have increased 10% year-on-year to INR 1,222 crores, and now constitute 22% of our sales. EMEA In so far as EMEA is concerned which constitutes our EU region and South African business, this registered strong growth of 20% year-on-year during the quarter. This has been driven by healthy growth in EU markets like UK from Luforbec® and other products. Growth Markets Our Growth markets include APAC and LATAM regions have grown 12% year- on-year during the period. The APAC market grew by 10% year-on-year during the quarter led by strong growth in markets like Australia. LATAM market grew 14% year-on-year in the quarter due to strong growth witnessed in Mexico. Profit and Loss Coming to the P&L aspects, Other operating income of INR 176 crores has increased by INR 76 crores this quarter. This mainly due to PLI and other export benefits during the quarter. Gross Margins Coming to the profitability, Q2 FY25 gross margins were 69.3% up from 68.4% in Q1, and 65.5% recorded in Q2 last year. The improvement is driven by multiple factors, which includes, product mix, tailwinds on input costs, lower share of in-licensed products, increased volumes, and various cost improvement and efficiencies which we have undertaken over the past several quarters. Barring any unforeseen circumstances in terms of our geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle East are concerned, we feel confident of maintaining a gross margin around these levels going ahead. Employee Benefit Expenses November 8, 2024 At INR 1,007 crores increased 17% year-on-year from INR 861 crores in Q2 FY24, and INR 971 crores in Q1 FY25, translating to 18.3% of sales vis-a-vis 17.4% last year and 17.6% in Q1 FY25. This change is largely attributable to higher cost, attributable to regular annual increments and business growth during the period. Manufacturing and Other Expenses Q2 FY25 manufacturing other expenses came in at INR 1,667 crores which translates to approximately 30.3% of sales as compared to 31.4% of sales in Q2 last year, and 29% of sales in Q1 FY25, reflecting a growth of 7%. The expenses are mainly higher due to higher R&D costs and some extraordinary provisioning leading to some disputes. Research and Development R&D is at INR 448 crores, which is 8.2% of sales in Q2 FY25 as compared to INR 350 crores at 6.3% of sales in Q1 FY25. Almost two-thirds of our R&D is directed towards complex portfolio. For the full year, R&D is expected to be around INR 1,800 crores. EBITDA Excluding Forex and other income, EBITDA was INR 1,308 crores vis-a-vis INR 923 crores, an increase of 42% year-on-year with margins of 23.8%, vis-a-vis 18.7% last year in the same period. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, margins have expanded by 50 basis points. This margin expansion is on the background of higher R&D spends, which have increased by 190 basis points quarter-on-quarter during this period. If you look at our EBITDA margin profile, we made improvements across all our key segments. Our gross margins are higher by almost 1% quarter-on-quarter, and there has been increase in the operating income and we benefited from cost savings all over. We also made additional provisions of INR 58 crores for an ongoing dispute. Putting this all together we believe that we should be able to deliver EBITDA margins in the range of 22% to 23% for the remaining fiscal. Tax On the tax line, our ETR is 18.7% during H1 FY25. For the full year, we expect it to be around 20% to 21%. Balance Sheet November 8, 2024 In so far as the balance sheet is concerned, operating working capital was about INR 6,562 crores as of 30th September against INR 5,691 crores in March ‘24, which translates to 107 days of net working capital against 105 days as of 31st March, and net debt is about INR 274 crores against INR 477 crores in March again. Whilst we focus on increased cash generation from our business, wed like to highlight that we continue to actively explore strategic allocation of our capital to address the long-term growth vision of the company. ESG On the ESG front, Lupin has achieved S&P Global ESG score of 76 in the recent bout of admissions from the concerned body, the industry average being just about 30 in the pharmaceutical sector. Our S&P score reaffirms our commitment to prioritizing sustainability and creating impact on sustainable healthcare solutions that benefit patients and communities worldwide. Seven of our Indian manufacturing sites got successfully reassessed for human rights assessment, with five sites retaining Platinum rating and two others moving from Gold to Platinum. With this we open the floor for discussions.",

And in Europe, our franchise is a branded generic franchise so that is one, and two neurology, again where we have a presence with NaMuscla® in Europe. We are looking to expand that into the larger indication. Right now its NDM and we have started to conduct a study for DM for global commercialization of NaMuscla® in particular Europe and the U.S. The focus is the two therapy areas that we are already present in. And very excited to really have Klaus on board. He brings in tremendous experience and in particular the two areas of our interest, respiratory as well as neurology. But as an organization, we will build this out in a cautious manner. As we have stated, I think in past interactions as well, we would like to really build with accretive assets in the near term as we continue to really drive our EBITDA margin expansion from the 23% level to the mid-20s and above over the next five years.

      "content": "Good evening friends, I am very pleased to welcome you to our Q3 Financial year ’2025 earnings call. I have with me our Managing Director Nilesh, our CFO Ramesh and our head of Investor relations Ravi. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as outlook for the year ahead. We are very happy to report another quarter of strong performance across our key markets both on a sequential and YoY basis. This has been backed by continued improvement in margins and profitability. I would like to highlight that our margins are the highest we have achieved in the last 5 years, despite higher investments in R&D during the period. We feel confident of maintaining our growth momentum going ahead with margins in the range of 22%-23% in the current fiscal year. Our US business delivered strong QoQ and YoY growth this quarter with revenues at a five year high. This has been led by volume growth in inline products and contribution from new products like Mirabegron that helped us offset the anticipated competition in products like Albuterol and Suprep®. Our respiratory portfolio continued strong with higher market shares in most of the key products. We look forward to a strong close to the current fiscal year, as well as continued momentum in the year ahead. Apart from key products like Tolvaptan, we have an exciting portfolio of injectable products like Glucagon, Risperdal Consta, Liraglutide which we anticipate bringing to market next fiscal year that should help us deliver strong growth in the year . We continue to improve our profitability in the US, led by better product mix and higher efficiencies in the base business. We are very optimistic of our long term growth strategy in the US as it continues to evolve from a commoditized generic business to more complex portfolio of injectables, respiratory and biosimilars, to ultimately a portfolio of strategic specialty assets. We believe that our pipeline will enable us to continue to drive the shift to complex products to over 50% of our portfolio over the next couple of years. Coming to India, we reported growth of 11.9% YoY led by growth in India Formulations business and additional tenders in our Global Institutional business. Our India Formulation business recorded growth of 9.1% for the 9M this fiscal year against an IPM growth of 8.2%. While key therapies like Diabetes, Cardiac, GI grew ahead of the market and we also increased our chronic share, muted growth in the respiratory category affected our overall performance during the quarter. We are very pleased to strengthen our diabetes portfolio by acquiring the Huminsulin range of products from Eli Lilly February 12, 2025 and also 3 trademarks from Boehringer Ingelheim for the Indian market. We feel confident on continuing to deliver above market growth in our India Formulation business, backed by our strong portfolio of innovative medicines and in-licensed products and our extensive reach through 10,000 people sales force. Switching to R&D, our R&D as % to sales was at 7.7% during the quarter and 7.4% for the 9M. We successfully filed Ranibizumab in EU during the quarter and are looking forward to the US filing in the coming quarters. We have an exciting pipeline, with more than 20 respiratory products and 40 injectable products in development and plan to file more than 30 ANDAs in the next 2 years, of which more than 50% will be complex products. As previously guided, we expect R&D to be around INR 1,800 crores for fiscal year 25, which would mean a significant increase in our R&D spends in Q4. From a compliance perspective, we received the EIR from the USFDA for our Pithampur Unit-1 manufacturing facility with VAI classification during the quarter. So far this year, we have received EIRs for Aurangabad and Dabhasa and have successfully completed inspections at Somerset and Nagpur Injectable Facility with zero observations. We would like to reiterate that we are committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with the USFDA and other regulatory agencies around the world. Before I hand it over to Ramesh, I would like to say that we remain optimistic to grow our business in the years ahead. Our R&D capabilities and pipeline are gaining momentum, be it our investments in various respiratory platforms like Ellipta and Respimat or the focus on complex platforms in injectables like iron colloids, peptides, 505 b(2)s and long acting Injectables and also our growing portfolio of biologics. We are also creating some unique differentiators like green propellant programs for our respiratory franchise. As I have mentioned earlier, we also continue to evolve our innovation pipeline to ramp up our specialty business in the years ahead. We believe our approach on the pipeline front and our commercial strategy will drive long term sustainable growth for the company and also build long term value for our shareholders. With this I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "Friends, I welcome you all to our Q3 FY25 earnings call. This has been another quarter of consecutive double digit growth across the top and profits lines. I am particularly pleased to highlight our EBITDA margins at 24.3% during the quarter, which is the highest we have achieved in the last 5 years. Now, Diving into the numbers. February 12, 2025 Sales Sales for Q3 FY25 came in at INR 5,619 crores as compared to INR 5,080 crores in Q3 last year, a growth of 10.6% YoY. On a 9M basis sales came in at INR 16,630 crores versus INR 14,761 crores last year, a growth of 12.7% YoY. We have registered robust growth across most of our key geographies. India business has grown by 11.9% YoY, North America has grown 12.3% YoY, EMEA grew 20.9% YoY whilst API grew 4% YoY. US Business During the quarter, the US business recorded sales of USD 235 million, a growth of 10.5% YoY and 6.8% QoQ on constant currency basis. On a 9M basis, US sales were USD 682 million, a growth of 12.5% as compared to 9M of FY24. As Vinita mentions, while we have benefited from volume growth in inline products and new product introductions, this has been offset by low single digit price declines in base products and anticipated new generic competition in products like Albuterol and Suprep®. Our respiratory portfolio continued their strong performance with high market shares in most key products like Albuterol and Arformoterol. We also continue to execute on our strategy to improve our profitability in this segment, with another quarter of strong profitability from this business. On the long term, we remain confident of consistent delivery of profitable growth through an increasing share of complex products in our portfolio. On a full year FY25 basis, we anticipate our US business to deliver double digit growth, ahead of our earlier guidance of high single digit growth in the segment. India The India business has grown by 11.9% YoY during the quarter and 16% YoY during the 9MFY25 period. Within this, the prescription business has grown 5.8% YoY during Q3FY25. On a 9MFY25 basis, the prescription business has grown at 9.1% outperforming IPM by 1.1X. Chronic share during the quarter was higher at 65% with key segments like Diabetes and Cardiology growing ahead of the IPM growth. The share of in-licensed products is around 12% similar to the 12% last year, which also positively impacts our profitability, going ahead. Other Businesses Revenues in our ex-India, ex North America Formulation businesses which include EMEA, ROW and Emerging Markets have increased 7.5% YoY to INR 1,277 crores and now constitute 23% of our sales. On a 9M basis, revenues have grown 12.6% YoY to INR 3,685 crores during the period. EMEA Our EMEA region, which constitutes our EU region business and South Africa business, registered strong growth of 20.9% YoY and 9.8% QoQ, during this quarter. This has been driven by healthy double-digit growth in EU markets like UK and Germany from products like Luforbec® and NaMuscla®. February 12, 2025 Emerging Markets Our Emerging Markets include the APAC and LATAM regions and have registered sales of INR 451 crores, a decline of 4.7% YoY. On a 9M basis, revenues grew 10.5% YoY to INR 1,456 crores. While LATAM markets like Brazil and Mexico grew in local currency terms, overall growth was impacted due to Fx in this region. Coming to P&L. Other Operating Income Other operating income at INR 149 crores has increased by INR 32 crores as compared to Q3FY24. This increase is mainly due to higher PLI and export benefits during the quarter. Gross Margins Coming to the profitability, Q3FY25 gross margins were 69.4% up from 66.0% in Q3 last year. On a 9M basis, the gross margins are at 69% versus 65.7% recorded in similar period last year, an improvement of 334 bps points. This improvement is driven by multiple factors which include better product mix, tail winds on input costs, lower share of in-licensed products, increased volumes and also various cost improvement and efficiencies which we have undertaken over the last several quarters. Employee Benefit expense Employee Benefit expense at INR 984 crores increased 10.7% YoY from INR 889 crores in Q3FY24 translating into 17.5% of sales. On a 9M basis, employee benefit expenses came in at INR 2,963 crores, an increase of 14.2% YoY translating to 17.8% as compared to 17.6% of sales in corresponding period last year. This change is largely attributed to higher costs attributable to regular annual increments and business growth during the period. Manufacturing & Other Expenses Q3FY25 came in at INR 1,696 crores, increasing 8.7% YoY from INR 1,667 crores in Q2 FY25 and INR 1,560 crores in Q3FY24 translating to 30.2% of sales versus 30.7% last year. On a 9M basis, manufacturing expenses came in at INR 4,936 crores, an increase of 7.7% YoY translating into 29.7% of sales as compared to 31.0% of sales in corresponding period last year. The expenses are higher mainly due to higher R&D costs and higher volumes in the normal course of business. R&D R&D is at INR 434 crores, 7.7% of sales as compared to INR 448 crores, 8.2 % of sales in Q2 FY25, with almost two thirds of our R&D directed towards complex portfolio. On a 9M basis, R&D is INR 1,232 crores or 7.4% of sales. For the full year, we expect R&D to be around INR 1,750-1,800 crores with a significant increase in R&D in Q4. February 12, 2025 EBITDA Excluding Forex and other income, EBITDA was INR 1,366 crores versus INR 1,022 crores last year, an increase of 33.7% YoY, with margins of 24.3% versus 20.1% last year in the same period. On a QoQ basis, margins have expanded 51bps. This margin expansion is on the backdrop of higher gross margins and lower fixed costs during the period. On a 9M basis, EBITDA was at INR 3,985 crores, up 42.1% YoY with margins of 24% as compared to 19% in the corresponding period last year. Putting all of this together, we believe that we should be able to deliver EBITDA margins in the region of 23-23.5% range in FY25. Tax As far as the ETR is concerned it was 19.1% during 9MFY25. For the full year, we expect the ETR to be around 20-21%. Balance sheet items Operating working capital was at INR 7,071 crores as on 31st December as against INR 5,691 crores of 31st March 2024 which translates to 113 days of net working capital as compared to 105 days as on 31st March 2024. Net debt was at INR 103 crores as against Rs 477 crores as on 31st March 2024. While we focus on increased cash generation from our business, we would also like to highlight that we continuously explore strategic allocation of our capital to ensure the long-term growth vision of the company. ESG In the last quarter, we strengthened our ESG efforts in both environmental and social areas through various initiatives and ensuring that our operations remain \"Water Positive\" year after year. Our focus on reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions strengthened which includes various renewable energy projects. We would like to update on ESG ratings. Lupin has received a Leadership ESG Score of “A-“ by CDP for Climate and Water. The \"A-\" rating from CDP includes Lupins performance in environmental transparency and management. The 2024 scores for Climate and Water represent an improvement from last years \"B\" rating in Climate and “C” rating in Water. Further, we have successfully launched an ESG Supplier Assessment with a third party, encompassing our critical suppliers. We conduct ongoing ESG webinars and workshops to support our key suppliers in enhancing their sustainability capacity. Lastly, our \"Lives Program\" has benefitted over 99,500 individuals till date. This program focuses on providing rural healthcare services to marginalized communities. With this, we open the floor for discussions. February 12, 2025",

If I remember right, then respiratory has become a more than 30% of revenue contributor putting all geography put together. And the current period is a kind of a respiratory pro respiratory season. So what kind of performance that you would have seen for the overall respiratory portfolio for the quarter?. We have seen moderation, lets say, in India, we have seen some kind of competition in the US relating to Albuterol to be specific. So given that, is there any risk that one should think or consider about this portfolio?",

And of course in India, we have the respiratory market growth at a muted level that is contributing to the lower growth. But overall, respiratory still continues to be a major therapy area for the organization. Its an area where we expect to bring all the material generic products to market across the globe and we expect to also innovate like we have done in India with the two triple novel combinations. We continue to work on respiratory green propellants for US, Europe as well as India plus other products we have the opportunity to bring to market, brands like Xopenex® in the US that have been fairly stable. And while we have a low growth in respiratory in India, were seeing the flu season pick up in the US again, were seeing another peak.

And assets like Xopenex® is a sweet spot for us, products that fit strategic aspirations, building on the respiratory front and ideally on market assets. But we know its difficult to really get on market assets. So were also looking at late-stage assets that are compelling from an investment perspective. And you know that we are a debt-free company at this point, so have the ability to invest for the right programs and opportunities. We havent earmarked but are committed for the right assets to explore as well as close wherever possible, both acquisitions. Simultaneously, we are also building a pipeline in the respiratory front with the capabilities we have; on the R&D side, the opportunities that we have on the green propellant front, to take the meter dose inhalers and come up with more climate-friendly and achieving both our sustainability goals and offering a differentiated product to the patients and the market. We continue to innovate on that front on the pipeline. So a combination of both pipeline as well as late-stage assets is what were looking at.",

      "content": "Thank you, Ravi. Well, its a real pleasure to meet all of you here today in person. I know we havent done a face-to-face meeting for a good number of years. The last time I recall we met, it was I think in 2022, when we were just coming out of COVID, had gone through a number of challenges that had impacted our performance. And from there, in 2022, with the efforts that we worked upon, I think about it, number one, execution of new product launches, in particular in the US, to turn around the US business, leveraging our complex generic portfolio to build Other Developed Markets, growing India and Other Emerging Markets on a consistent basis. At the same time, focus on cost optimization whether its footprint rationalization or broad efficiency measures, and third, our quality and compliance efforts that enabled us to work through our OAI sites, 3 sites in particular, have really enabled us to turn our business around over the last 3 years. We are very pleased that fiscal year ‘25 has been a stellar year for the organization where we have continued the momentum, the growth momentum, as well as continue to evolve our strategic growth drivers and capabilities to continue to grow in the future. So we look forward to sharing with you our performance thus far and our plans going forward. So before that, I will just start with where Lupin is today. When you look at our company globally, we are the 12th largest generic company by revenues. We had a great year with USD 2.7 billion in revenue and USD 625 million in EBITDA, delivered by a very strong group of Lupinytts. When you look at our presence across our key markets, we have a leadership position in all our key markets. Starting with the US, where we are the 3rd largest company by prescriptions dispensed. India, where we are the 8th largest, primarily organically. I mean there are companies that have done acquisitions that have gone above us but from an organic growth standpoint, we have consistently May 15, 2025 grown our India business. And other markets like Australia, where we are the 4th largest company on the generic front, and South Africa, where we are the 8th largest company on the generic front. So really a substantial position in all our critical markets, driven by a very strong pipeline of generics, branded drugs, as well as complex generics. If you look at our business globally, for this past year, its very well diversified. You look at the Developed Markets and the Emerging Markets. The US and Other Developed Markets are roughly 50%, India and Other Emerging markets are roughly 50%. And when you look at the nature of the business, the India and Emerging Market is primarily branded business. US, Other Developed Market is primarily generic business. So very well diversified business geographically. Very pleased with the progress we have made on the ESG front. So its been a stellar year for us, not only from a financial perspective, building on the growth momentum but also growing sustainably as an organization. So this is our current footprint around the world. In particular, on the manufacturing front, we have a very strong footprint that supports our generic business globally, with 15 manufacturing sites around the world, 4 in the Americas, 2 in the US in particular, that give us tremendous capability and flexibility to be able to manufacture more in the US If it made sense, based on the tariff considerations and also the economic incentives that the government puts in place, if its attractive, we will have the flexibility to manufacture more in the US Look at our R&D centres, seven R&D centres around the world, including 4 in the Americas again, 2 in the US, as well as in Mexico and Brazil, and then 1 in the Netherlands, the Nanomi long-acting injectable R&D centre in Nanomi. So tremendous capabilities on the R&D and manufacturing front to drive our growth going forward as an organization. You look at our manufacturing plants, in particular, for the US, we have 12 plants that serve the US market. Id say 11 right now because the Pune biotech facility is yet to be approved by the FDA, but have multiple manufacturing sites that are approved by the FDA, as well as other regulators that enable us to build our generic business. So if you look at our major pillars of growth, you saw our purpose statement that we take a lot of pride in. We put a lot of effort in crystallizing that statement and are very proud of catalysing treatments, both across innovative medicines as well as affordable medicines to serve the communities and the patients that we provide drugs to. When you look at our major pillars of our business, the US in particular has come a long way for the organization, evolving our portfolio from the simple products to complex generics, in particular on the inhalation front, very soon on the injectable front as well, fiscal year ‘26 is going to be a material year on the injectables front, and biosimilars, which is an opportunity that is emerging now for us. Theres been a lot of back and forth on the biosimilars front over the last couple of years, but given the change from a regulatory perspective, May 15, 2025 the FDA reducing the requirements for interchangeability studies, as well as the private label model appearing in the US, the US is emerging as an attractive biosimilars market, of course with selective portfolio choices. We also continue to operate our legacy business of oral solids, ophthalmic, dermatology, and leverage product opportunities that differentiate us, like you have seen Mirabegron, Tolvaptan that is going to be a material contributor in fiscal year ‘26. So the US is on a very strong foundation, a very strong trajectory from a growth perspective in the next couple of years. Other Developed Markets, especially Europe, Canada, Australia, leveraging our portfolio in the US, the platforms in the US, complex generics are the largest part of growth in Other Developed Markets and allow us to really build both on our capacities, manufacturing as well as R&D capabilities, to gain operating leverage across the globe. In India, we continue to focus on delivering growth above the market. The last 5 years, the last 10 years, we have consistently grown above the market. Wed like to grow 1.2, 1.3 times the market and we have done that in many years. The last couple of years, with the loss of exclusivity on-inlicensed products, the growth has been a little below that, but its still been above market growth over the last many years. Our strategy is both innovative products as well as a pipeline that we have built internally as well as licensed through partners, and acquisitions. You saw recently we acquired the insulin brand from Lilly, which enables us to really gain the end-to-end economics on the product. And we will continue to look at acquisition opportunities to bolster our portfolio in the India business. Simultaneously, we also are expanding our footprint. We have done pretty well in terms of sales force expansion over the last couple of years, and continue to focus on expanding our footprint as a business within India. Also, you have seen us getting into strategic adjacencies that enable us to go beyond the pill, beyond the prescription medicine, into diagnostics, digital, OTC products that enable us to bring a full solution to the patient as opposed to just the prescription. We are starting to see the benefits of the strategy. We are starting to see the impact of the strategy on our prescription business, and we will continue to evolve these areas to be able to both strategically contribute to our position in the marketplace as well as build value through these efforts. Other Emerging Markets, in particular South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Philippines, we have strong local businesses that are pretty self-sustaining. All of them tend to really run the business on a positive cash flow, on growing profitably, primarily through their own pipeline developed internally or in- licensed, but also, where possible, integrate with Lupins pipeline in particular in the key areas like respiratory, CNS, biologics as well. In the Emerging Markets we also have a strong position in institutional business with our TB Portfolio, which is the companys legacy business. I am very proud that we are continuing to maintain a leadership position in this segment. On the API front, we have built substantial scale, and its enabled us to really build a very strong reliability of supply on the generic side of the business. This has been a critical piece of discussion in the US conversations very May 15, 2025 recently, where the US would like to bring API manufacturing in the US if possible but we as an organization have more than 50% of our generic portfolio vertically integrated through our own APIs that enables us to really have a very strong cost position as well as reliability of supply that we have been able to leverage to ensure that we meet the market requirements on a consistent basis. We also have leveraged the API business and capabilities to build a CDMO business, as you saw. This past year, we have made significant progress there in terms of the teams and capabilities and we will continue to evolve our CDMO business based on these API capabilities to be able to build value with this vertical. So, multiple growth drivers in the organization, that give us the confidence of consistent growth going forward. So, when I look at the journey over the last 5 years, there are many areas to highlight. On the commercial front, the turnaround of the US business was a material event for us over the last couple of years that enabled us to get back to consistent growth and more importantly profitable growth for the organization, and evolve our EBITDA margins on a consistent basis over the last 10 to 12 quarters. On the complex generic front, we were the first Indian company to launch a DPI in the US We were very proud with Spiriva® to be able to get that approval in 2023 and launch it as a sole generic. We are still the only generic in the marketplace. It took us long, 5 years from filing to get FDA approval but its enabled us to build Respiratory as a major vertical for our business in the US When I look at our MDI and DPI business in the US, right now its one-third of our US portfolio from a revenue’s perspective. So a material contributor to our business in the US as well as globally and also differentiates us as an organization. In India, we have expanded our position with 11 new divisions, a field force up from, it was 5,000, I think, 5 years ago, to 10,000 plus at this point, so significant expansion that has enabled us to grow above the market growth rate in the country. If you look at our chronic share in India, so again, we are very proud of this accomplishment. Five years ago, the picture looked very different. Our chronic share was sub 60% Today, its 64% chronic, so more sustainable, more profitable business. When we compare ourselves with our peers, we are actually one of the best mix of chronic versus acute as an organization in India. We have continued to focus on commercial excellence in areas that we felt needed dedicated focus, like the trade generics business that we recently spun out into a wholly-owned subsidiary, with the idea of really focusing hard on driving that business given the growth of the trade generics business in India, and Lupin Manufacturing Solutions, which again as I mentioned in the previous slide, on the API front, allows us to leverage our capabilities on the API R&D and manufacturing to build a CDMO business. We have also had strategic acquisitions over the last 5 years. Xopenex® in the US enabled us to get into the brand side of the business. When Sunovion was looking to get out of the market, we thought it was a strategic opportunity for us to have a foot into the brand business on the respiratory front in particular. May 15, 2025 The product has grown since we acquired with very limited promotion efforts, so we are looking at how we can build further on this start. Medisol in France that enabled us to get into, we didnt have a presence in France until we acquired Medisol, which gave us a very nice injectables portfolio that enables us to build our internal pipeline on top of this to build a business in France. And Southern Cross in Australia that allowed us to almost double our business, has been a significant contributor to growth in the Australian market and has enabled us to get to that position of 4th largest generic in the Australian market. If you look at the material product launches over the last 5 years, Suprep® from Somerset, Albuterol from India, Spiriva® that I just mentioned, our first dry powder inhaler in the US, Mirabegron, material contributor in the last fiscal year and continues to be this fiscal year as well. In India, we were very pleased to launch differentiated products like Difizma and Vilfuro, unique novel respiratory products that enable us to differentiate our product offering with the pulmonologist. In Europe, Luforbec® which is a Fostair® generic has enabled us to really double our business in Europe, so significant contributor to growing our business in Europe that has done extremely well over the last 3 to 5 years. And NaMuscla®, our first orphan drug, our first brand in Europe has grown very nicely over the last 5 years as well. We are actually in the process of the second indication. We started with the NDM indication which is smaller indication. DM indication is much larger. We are going through a phase 3 study at present for the DM indication in Europe as well as the US that will enable us to maximize this brand globally. And lastly, Etanercept, which has been a material contributor to our business in Europe as well as other parts of the world, Japan, Southeast Asia, Latin America. We are very pleased with how things are evolving in the US and will determine how we commercialize this product in the US in the years ahead. 2029 is when the patent goes off in the US If you look at the impact on the financials, we have improved our gross margins from 64 %, 5 years ago to 69 %. Look at our EBITDA margins, gone from 16% to 24%. We are a zero-debt company at this point, have strong cash flows and have considerably improved our ROCE from the 10 % level to 20 %. So very pleased with the financial results of all of the efforts over the last many years. On the compliance front, we have made material strides, getting 3 of our sites, Pithampur, Goa, Somerset out of warning letters to a VAI status. I am confident if the FDA was to visit the 2 pending sites, Mandideep as well as Tarapur, our sites are ready to receive them. But we dont have any pending products from the sites, so they dont have any hurry to come in and inspect these sites. But I am confident in the near future we will get those sites cleared as well. The last couple of years, its not been quiet. We have had multiple inspections across all of our different facilities and we have sailed through each of them. So looking forward to continuing that strong trajectory going forward. You can see the impact of all of these efforts over the last 5 years. I just mentioned the financial results but as you can see from the chart, the last 3 years has May 15, 2025 been a really strong trajectory for us and has also reflected in the shareholder value that has built over the last few years. So for fiscal year ‘25, you have already seen the numbers, so I am not going to reiterate them. Its been a stellar year from a revenue growth standpoint, from a margin growth standpoint, from a net income standpoint. But we are very pleased that all our markets, all our regions, grew this past year. And the majority of them grew double-digit. If you look at India, it grew at 14%. North America grew at 16%. US per se grew at 17%. EMEA grew 22%, so a stellar year in EMEA. APAC grew 5%. LATAM grew 10% after a Mexico facility came back up last year. Its now back to the pre-closure levels. So very pleased with the growth there as well. The Rest Of World, along with our GIB business, the tuberculosis TB tender business grew 11%, and our API business grew 3%. So a stellar year for us as an organization. So I want to switch from there to a couple of the trends in our industry. As we are looking at the industry, certainly a lot happening in the US but also multiple other trends that pose both challenges as well as opportunities for us as an organization. If I look at the geopolitical situation, a lot of things happening around the globe that really put India in a very strong position, in particular as countries and regions are de-risking from China. The US in particular is very focused on de-risking from China, and India I think is very well positioned to leverage that opportunity on multiple fronts. Tariffs are certainly going to shape the trade relationships between countries. The US is every day, every week in the news about tariffs on China, tariffs on other countries, tariffs on India. We are hopeful that, based on the bilateral trade negotiation between India and the US, the importance of Indian pharma sector in the US, given 50% of the prescriptions in the US come from India, that we are going to be able to convince the stakeholders to have either zero tariff or limited tariff on drugs from India. Certainly theres been a statement from the Trump administration on that front in the last couple of weeks that sounded promising, so fingers crossed on that front. Theres a paradigm shift in the US healthcare industry with all of the changes the new administration has made, a number of areas that are impacted so far. Many healthcare programmes have been impacted. A lot of research funding has been impacted in the US DOGE has made material cuts across multiple areas. FDA has lost 20,000 people. Thankfully the reviewers are still there. I mean, they cut a lot of the policy folks but not the review branch that actively reviews and approves products. The Inflation Reduction Act, you know, the government is actively reviewing the pill penalty on IRA. As a number of you might know, the IRA allowed HHS to negotiate drug pricing for biologics 13 years after the product is approved, while on small molecules its 9 years after product is approved, which was considered really a discrimination against small molecules. And that is under active review at this point, so we expect that it could land in the same place as biologics. You have heard in the last couple of days, MFN, you know, the executive order from the Trump administration linking the pricing in the US to Most Favored Nation pricing across Developed Markets in particular. We are going to see how this evolves. I think a lot of analysts are saying this is more bark than bite. At this point, you know, a number of big pharma companies have made commitments to invest May 15, 2025 in the US and very likely will renegotiate or backtrack those commitments if the government is going to peg pricing to overseas markets. We know that the US market actually funds for majority of the innovation in our industry, so really reducing pricing in the US is going to have a significant impact on the innovation front in the pharmaceutical industry. Theres growing talk about onshoring manufacturing in the US As I mentioned, this is likely going to be very closely linked with what the administration does on the MFN front, also very closely linked to what happens on tariffs, if there are material tariffs in place and theres an economic incentive to manufacture locally that makes products more viable. Certainly there will be an opportunity to expand manufacturing in the US. Switching to India, the pharma industry in India is poised to grow, double in the next 5 years, and this is not just in India, but also exports from India outside of the country. So its expectation of the revenues of the entire industry out of India is expected to double over the next 5 years. This would be fuelled a good part by the growth in the middle class, you know, thats expected to be 170 million people by 2030 and also very pleased that the government is now supporting ‘Develop in India’ in the new R&D scheme, the research scheme, incentive scheme that the government has talked about putting in place. Just like the production link scheme, PLI scheme, that has really benefited the industry in the last 5 years, we expect that this will certainly encourage more innovation in India and was much needed for the country. The India opportunities pivoting from pharma alone to overall healthcare, we talked a little bit about this in our context and patient-centric adjacencies like diagnostics, digital health, consumer health is gaining momentum. So the full solution for patients and physicians is gaining momentum in India. On the generic side of the business for the Developed Markets, there certainly is a move towards complex generics, as well as specialty. We see multiple companies moving in that direction, both on the complex generic front as well as the 505(b)(2), as well as innovation front., On the complex generics front, we have executed in multiple areas, inhalation in particular, but also on the specialty, 505(b)(2) front we have active portfolio together, pipeline together of both transformative opportunities as well as incremental innovation that will help us differentiate our portfolio in countries like the US as well as Other Developed Markets. We have seen over the last couple of years’ blockbuster drug classes emerge like the GLP-1s, diabetes, obesity class that is set to grow to USD 100 billion over the next 5 years. So certainly a material opportunity that has emerged in the marketplace. And as some of these products go off patent, like Semaglutide in particular goes off patent in March of next year in a handful of countries, it will open the market for further expansion on this class of drugs. Likewise, theres also an emergence on the biologics front. In India in particular, we are seeing emergence of biologics in particular in areas like immunology and oncology that is set to grow very nicely. Lastly, the rising impact of AI across industries and in pharma as well. On the brand side of the industry, theres certainly a very strong focus on drug May 15, 2025 development front through AI, delivering efficiency, from a timing as well as cost perspective. On the generic side of the business as well, there are multiple areas where we have potential gains here, from an efficiency standpoint, commercial execution standpoint, operation standpoint, cost optimization as well as quality perspective - that our industry is going to leverage. So a lot going on across the globe in our industry. So that brings me to our strategic areas of focus as an organization, looking at all of these trends, the areas that we have prioritized for our organization. Number one is to sustain our growth in our 2 major regions, India as well as the US. And based on the portfolio we have, based on the investments that we plan to make, we are confident of continuing to grow in both regions in the foreseeable future. Second is expanding our inhalation business. We have established a very strong position on the respiratory front. Today, if I look at our global turnover, 25% or so is on the respiratory side. We were always very strong in India, but over the last 5 years we have built a significant presence in the US, Europe and emerging in other parts of the world like Canada, Australia on the respiratory front. So we continue to build on this pillar, as well as innovate. I mean, there is a material move in particular in countries like Europe to move towards green propellants on the metered-dose inhalers and we believe we are at the forefront with this. Our R&D teams, our manufacturing teams have looked at our evolution from a pipeline perspective on the green propellant side, both for India as well as developed markets like US, Europe and other parts of the world. Third, delivering on our new product launches “on time and on budget” is a major part of our focus. Its been a substantial success for us over the last 3 years. Our team has come a long way in ensuring that the products that we target, we deliver them in time. And thats how youve seen products like Mirabegron, products like Tolvaptan, products like Spiriva® come to market in time and theres a very strong focus in the organization to deliver our new product launches. Number four is establishing a Speciality business. I mean, a number of you know, we have had a legacy speciality business in the US. We actually started the US business on the speciality front, on the paediatrics side. Then over the years, we went into the womens health side of the business, which we had some success with and got out when we saw challenges 3-4 years ago, when we went through the downturn. We are refocusing our efforts on building the speciality side of the business, both with acquisitions as well as internal pipeline, especially the 505(b)(2) pipeline that we are developing in-house. Fifth is establishing injectables and biosimilars as a growth driver for the future. I mean, we have capabilities across both in R&D and manufacturing, as you know. And this year in particular, were going to see a material inflection on the injectables front with products like Glucagon, products like Liraglutide, Risperdal Consta® from Nanomi coming to market. And with the emerging biologics opportunities with the FDA regulations easing up, as well as the private label business emerging in the US, we expect biosimilars to be May 15, 2025 a material growth driver going forward. Of course, as barriers reduce, the competition tends to increase. So we are very selective with our portfolio here to ensure that we are either in the first wave or we are one of a few players that will enable us to get a solid return on our investment with biologics, as well as grow the business on a sustainable basis. Sixth is establishing a novel product pipeline. I mentioned the 505(b)(2) pipeline that we are developing internally on our long-acting injectable platform, on our respiratory platform, some oral solids as well, that will help us build both our speciality business and in some cases also help us build a hospital business in the US in particular. Then building scale across other developed generic markets. So we believe that the platforms that we have in place and the pipeline that we have in place whether its on the respiratory front, biologics front, or the injectables front, has tremendous opportunities outside of the US, in particular in Europe, Canada, as well as Australia-like countries and theres a tremendous opportunity for us to gain operating leverage from these platforms across the global generics market, especially in the Developed Markets. So very focused on growing our European business and Other Developed Markets at a faster pace through these strengths that we have established. And lastly, Id say that continued focus on the cost position across our network. The bulk of our business is still generics, and cost optimization has to be a consistent effort to drive profitability on the generic side of the business. Theres still tremendous opportunities. As much as we have gained a lot of efficiencies over the last 5 years, theres still a lot of opportunities that we have on the operational front, on the supply chain front, on the quality front, to be able to continue to improve our cost position as an organization. All of this is enabled by, number one, our focus in quality and compliance. We have an aspiration to be best in class in compliance. We were best in class 10 years ago, and theres no reason why we cant get to this goal in the next few years. We are exploring areas that we can leverage digital and AI to get more efficient, to get more creative as an organization. Its a big lever that is yet to unfold, yet to really conclude what areas make sense for us to double down. But we have embarked on 5 or 6 material areas where we believe we can make a material difference through AI as well as digital. And last and most importantly is our people’s strategy. I mean, all of what you have seen so far has been delivered by a very strong, committed team, and we continue to work on our team both developing our people internally as well as bringing in capabilities from the outside to compliment and drive growth going forward along with our internal team. So very strong areas of growth that we have identified for ourselves. Were very focused on each of these areas and are confident that we will continue to grow our business on a consistent basis in the years to come ahead. So with that, I will hand it over to Nilesh to walk us through a deeper review of the business.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. First of all, thank you for coming today. We used to always love doing this investor meet in person and COVID derailed it and then we did May 15, 2025 it in 2022. Then we didnt do it for a couple of years after. We certainly hope to do this regularly. We just think its a wonderful opportunity to engage with you today. Vinita talked about people. I will just quickly introduce some of our people. Ranjana, our Head of Quality. Rakesh, our CIO. Christoph, our Head of Tech Ops. Rajiv, our head of India region. Yash, our HR head. Moving to the next table, Tommaso, Vinitas Chief of Staff. Saurabh, from our India region, the power behind Rajiv. Sumita, Head of Business Development for India. Mohan, in charge of taxes. Amit, our Company Secretary. Robin, our finance team. Suresh, from our finance group. And then last of all, Ravi. Im missing out a few in the back but I think this is an opportunity for you to see some of the power behind Lupin as well. So on the business side, I think the biggest change which has happened is the US business, where we were in this slump and then we have grown the US from a net sales perspective back up to the USD 900-plus million, USD 925 million, year-on-year growth of 13%. That is obviously one of the biggest moves that we have had in the Lupin numbers. As you know, we have been number three in the US in terms of generic market share, 4.9% market share. Were very proud of the position that we have and especially at times like today when Indias role is being questioned, when tariffs are coming in question, I think a very important lever in this all is the market share that we have. We are very proud of the market share that we have in the US And you have seen this before, but in terms of the number of products, about 138 products in the market, 105 of them were in the top three, 45 were number one. We have more than a hundred products pending in the pipeline, addressing a market size of close to USD 150 billion. And you know the recent NPLs, Mirabegron, Spiriva®, Pred Forte®, and of course earlier this week, Tolvaptan. So obviously on a very, very good trot from a launch perspective. As Vinita mentioned, the focus is on cost efficiency and optimization. And then obviously we want to build on that base business that we have of specialty. We have Xopenex® and NaMuscla® that we have but you know, this was legacy for us. We started with Suprep® in the US So we certainly want to build out that specialty. But if you really see what thats done, I mean, if you look at the journey in the last five years, , USD 800 million went to USD 720 million, USD 738 million, USD 632 million. I mean, that obviously was a very disruptive time for Lupins P&L. And if you see the last three years, you see that consistent 21% growth in the business. Were very proud of the way that we have turned this around. And obviously our collective goal is to sustain this growth that we have had and build on this business. Obviously, thats come from the move to complex generics. So if you see in FY25, complex generics is about 30% of our revenues. If you look at the next five years, that complex generics will move to 49% of revenues. And then obviously the key growth drivers for the generics business remains NPLs, more than 100 plus NPLs. And 65% of revenues that we will get will come from complex generics. Over 60 filings in the next five years, focused highly on First to File, on Para 4 products. And then clearly in the US, the key imperative would, other than the move getting deeper into complex generics, would be to build on specialty, both through our own portfolio but through acquisitions and alliances as well. May 15, 2025 On our second key market, India, were ranked number eight. Were not happy at all with this rank. I think we have to be in the top five but currently number eight. Good growth rate in the last 10 years, 12%, 1.2 times the market growth rate, 3.4% market share, our key therapy areas, as you know, are Diabetes, Cardiovascular and Respiratory. GI is actually the fourth largest therapy area for us. Doing well in Diabetes and Cardio. Respiratory has been extremely sluggish in the last two years. I think this will be the year that it will bounce back as well. GI, again, growing very strong, double digit. Vinita mentioned the sales force size, but total more than 10,000 people across the sales team. Clearly, our focus is on building the innovation pipeline for India and part of that is going to come from very strong in-licensing as well. So if you see the India business and just double-clicking on that a little bit, if you split it between the IL, the in-license and the non-IL, you will see that the in-license portfolio actually helped us grow in the past., Even in 2021-22, you see the growth coming from the darker green bar, which is in-license portfolio. The last three years, that portfolio has been challenged. De-growth in FY23 of 13% in that portfolio, minus 1% and minus 12% in FY24 & FY25 respectively and despite that minus 12% growth, we have grown at 8.4%, versus the market growth of 8% in FY25. The loss of exclusivity, the erosion on the in-license part has largely played out and therefore from FY26, we see getting back on the double-digit growth across the portfolio and continuing double-digit growth going forward. The focus, as Vinita mentioned, is on chronic. If you look at the current portfolio, 64% of sales come from chronic. If you see by FY30, itll actually move to 70%, 69% - 70%. So we actually will get even deeper onto the chronic side. Number two in Respiratory, number three in Diabetes, number three in Cardiac as well. The growth going forward, first of all, the aspiration is to grow at 1.2 to 1.3 times the market. Part of that is its going to come from enhanced reach, over 2,000 representatives to be added in the next four, five years. Basically programmatically, we want to add the 400-500 representatives every year. A scientific approach, when were reaching out to doctors and the community including the patients that we would work with as well. NPLs, new product launches, is going to be a key growth driver, over 80 products in our portfolio for the next five years. Focus will remain on chronic therapy areas. Obviously, as a large cardiac and diabetes player, GLP-1s is going to be an important part of that play. But also beyond that, getting deeper into GI, building that as the fourth large therapy area for us, getting into oncology, we are there but we are fledgling in our presence. So oncology, CNS, Vitamins, scaling up in these areas as well, as the next three areas that will come into our India region. Obviously, partnering as the market is changing with e-commerce, with organized retail, with the institutional business as well. We have evolved organization structure to meet with that. . Before that, the extra urban. This is a part of the market that we feel is very exciting. I think really going into tier two, tier three, we started with the pilot. The pilot was successful. We are now scaling up, and thats where the major addition in sales force is happening this year. Obviously, we would look at May 15, 2025 opportunities in India. There are few and far between but we want to be there. We have acquired a few, but not of scale. I think that is certainly an organization priority and then moving closer to physicians, closer to patients through our adjacencies as well. Other Developed Markets, I think Europe is, you know, we have always talked about the fact that we built India and the US and in that neglected Europe, we are certainly focused on Europe at this point of time. Its grown to a reasonable scale, USD 195 million in the last fiscal, 14% growth rate in the last five years. Obviously, products like NaMuscla®, the respiratory portfolio is driving the business in the Europe including Etanercept Biosimilar. We are in a few regions and the others are through Pan-European partnerships. So nice reach across Europe but to be scaled. If you look at the next five years, 50 plus NPLs in Europe, 55% of revenues will actually come from complex generics and obviously expand into other markets with our own onshore presence within Europe. Canada, again, a nice little business, USD 47 million sales, FY25, 18% CAGR for the last five years and 60% of the business coming from specialty. And if you look again, going forward, complex generics will drive that portfolio, a lot of it led by inhalation. And lastly, on the Other Developed Markets, Australia, USD 78 million sales. Were ranked number four in the Australian generic market, 20% CAGR in the last five years, growth led by both our own business but our partnered business within Australia as well. The focus is on new product launches there, including biosimilars and were expanding into the New Zealand market as well. To the next bucket, Other Emerging Markets, South Africa, USD 83 million, number one rank in cardiovascular, the eight largest generic company in South Africa. Focus again, remains new product launches. There as a large cardiac player to move into GLP-1s as well, participating in ARV tenders as well. Philippines, close to USD 40 million in sales. We are number two ranked in our reference market in that, again, a very wide portfolio of products. Youll see GLP-1s everywhere but 50-plus launches including biosimilars planned for the Philippines. Mexico, about USD 50 million. Net sales, we are number three, ranked as an ophthalmic player. 70% of our revenues come from ophthalmics and more than 20 products lined up for launch including NaMuscla®. Brazil, USD 42 million, number three rank in their reference market. 40% of our portfolio in Brazil is OTC. Were looking at point-of-sales expansion and we are looking at new product launches across multiple therapy areas in Brazil. May 15, 2025 Lastly, our GIB business actually had one of the best CAGR’s across our businesses, 20% in the last five years. Growth obviously led by scaling up TB, including prevention of tuberculosis with products like Rifapentine and building out the HIV portfolio as well. So the adjacencies, really quickly, we dont talk that much about those. On Lupin Diagnostics, 44% year-on-year revenue growth. We have been amongst our peers fastest to get to INR 100 crores. All our labs are approved by NABL, and that was a key part because we want to be a trusted partner on the diagnostic side. That is our differentiation in this area. The target is to be EBITDA positive in FY27. Pretty good reach across most cities. Were not in North India. Other than that, were actually across most geographies in India. Lupin Life is our OTC business, INR 150 crores, big plans to grow. The aspiration is to well more than double this in the next three to four years. A lot of reach being expanded at this point of time. We have two anchor products. There are two more products that were launching as well. So small business today but certainly another anchor to growth in India. Our digital health, we have talked about this a little bit but this has been a challenging part of the business for us because youre actually changing physician and patient behaviour. So its been slow. I think its getting to that inflection point at this point. The goal there is to be the partner of choice for post-discharge care of cardiac patients. We have our first product. Theres a follow-on product. The focus here is connected devices, AI-powered apps, experienced healthcare professionals backing it up. If somebody has a cardiac event, we want to be the partner of choice post-discharge. Lupin Life Sciences is our trade generics business. We launched this last year, obviously building on the equity of the Lupin brand and quality products from Lupin. The focus is primarily on tier two and tier three towns and areas where were currently under-prescribed and we are building a lot of on-the-ground presence with more than 400 people in that field force, which is different from the model which many other people do it. The idea there is really to emerge as a strong player in this space. And the last of the adjacencies, Lupin Manufacturing Solutions, our CDMO business. We have a full Global team, all the structures in place. I think we have taken a lot of effort to put the team together in the course of the last year. We have this legacy of developing complex products including fermentation products. And we have large-scale manufacturing from a CGMP perspective as well. And we have an R&D center in Pune. That really positions us to be able to work on innovation pipeline but also to carve out our own differentiation within the space. And part of that is going to be in areas like peptides or in ADCs. On the R&D and the portfolio, its been over 20 years. And we started with the First to Files. Right now, were pursuing 30-plus First to Files, as I mentioned. Then we moved into inhalation. We really have that franchise across the inhalation space. So MDIs, DPIs, SMIs even. So obviously getting May 15, 2025 deep into inhalation across the US, India, across Europe as well, to expand to other geographies as well. Building that presence next on injectables, on the complex injectables in particular, depo injections, peptides, liposomal products as well. We will talk a little bit more of our pipeline in the next few slides. Biosimilars, where we built a nice commercial presence ex-US but the intention of course is to be meaningful in the US on that as well. And what we have is absolutely world- class R&D and manufacturing capabilities and the ability to do a pretty wide array of products. And the last on the product development and capability building is obviously Specialty. Building out the 505(B)(2), building out the value-added medicines, whether its long-acting injectables, oral solids, IUDs implants, green propellants as well. So you see a wide array of capabilities that we’ve built over the years. And what its really done is deliver on the business. So if you see the US, FY20 complex generics was 2% of the business, grew to 34% in FY25. And if you see again the next five years, will grow to 55% of the business in the US. In Europe, , 9% was the composition of complex platforms in FY20, 55% at this point of time and growing to two-thirds of the business by FY30. I wont talk through the entire portfolio that has driven this but obviously we have had some nice launches. We had Etanercept. We obviously had Albuterol in the US in 2020. Luforbec® that we launched in Europe became a big anchor product. Then obviously came products like Tiotropium and theres a whole slew of products, especially on the inhalation side, which have helped deliver this. If you look at the upcoming launches and we were cognizant that we have obviously had a good last year. We have a good FY26 as well. Whats happening in FY27? Its actually a good portfolio coming in FY27 as well. Three products that we intend to launch on the inhalation side, a couple of products on the injectable side, biosimilars, two products that will come to market and a couple of important oral solids that will come out as well and our first specialty product in FY27. Before that in FY26, you see injectables picking up. You see Glucagon, you see Liraglutide, you see Risperidone long-acting, that we hope to launch this year. Etanercept in Australia, obviously Tolvaptan, which we have launched and another oral solution, that we will launch, which will be a key product as well. This is on the back of good number of products in the market. So again, , in inhalation, 12 products in the market across geographies, injectable, over 10 products, biosimilars, obviously Etanercept only at this point of time and the oral solids, obviously well over 300 products over time. And you see the products in the pipeline, and inhalation, thats where we are all in, 30 products in the pipeline. Injectable, another 30 products that are in that pipeline as well. Biosimilars, we have over 10 products in the pipeline. And obviously all the other dosage forms kind of adds up in the number as well. If you look further, if you look at FY28, you see more of that inhalation, you see injectables, you see the biosimilars coming to market as well. And in FY29, you see a whole slew of inhalation products that will come to market and thats I think, when we will get steady on the injectable side as well. So we May 15, 2025 can talk more about this but if you see the pie chart at the bottom, I think those are the revenues of new product launches that will come from Complex Generics. So if you see FY26, obviously products like Tolvaptan are contributing significantly to the new product revenues. But FY27, you see a very large portion, 55% coming from Complex Generics. Similar in FY28, 54%, even higher. FY29, 61% coming from Complex Generics and even higher thereafter with 62% revenues coming from Complex Generics in FY30. Quickly on quality, you know, we have color-coded this a little differently because we wanted to add the biotech facility which is pending. Like we said, we have got two sites which have been in a non-satisfactory state of compliance. Obviously biotech, were pending approval from the US as well. So we have put that into the list. Other than that, obviously the rest of the facilities have been inspected regularly and have good standing. As you would see over the years, I think FY20 was obviously the worst where we had five sites which were not in a satisfactory state of compliance. Now down to two. We have had a bunch of inspections. EIR’s from about five sites that have been received in the last year. Our goal is, one, to be best in class. Two, to target all sites to be ready at any point of time for an inspection. Were looking at really the supply chain. So its not just us. What happens before us with KSM’s or API’s that we would buy? So thats part of the ensuring quality. And the other part is on training. Can we really use training as a differentiator? Focusing a lot more on training than what we did in the past. And lastly, you know, we talked about Christoph. We have set this Global Tech Ops function. Very good results over the last few years on this. If you look at from a customer focus perspective, our OTIF levels are at 100%.. Even for India, 98%. Lowest ever backorder, lowest ever FTS. And our focus is on de- risking. Whether its from China or whether its other single source entities, we are working to build agility into the system so that our lead times just keep getting better and better. Thats our focus. I think theres a lot more that we would want to do on that customer focus path. On the cost leadership, we have talked in the past. USD 50 million were delivered last year through AVDs, through freight optimization, yield improvement and the like. Were optimizing our global footprint. Our air ocean ratio is down to an all-time low. Basically, its only new product launches that we would send by air. Everything else pretty much goes by ocean. Again, the supply chain is really, really working, including our manufacturing, procurement and the like. And the next anchor on this is technology leadership, whether it is AI or digital transformation. We have Kinaxis, which enables the entire organization globally. We have several of our sites which are fully paperless. And on the backbone of that, you can imagine what you can do with AI today. And now were investing a lot more into automation and the like, continuous flow reactors. We started with one or two use cases. Now theres three or four cases that we are considering. Robotics that were introducing into some of our plants as well. So very exciting time from a manufacturing perspective. I will hand over to Ramesh now. May 15, 2025",

      "content": "Thank you, Nilesh. So friends, we are meeting after a gap of nearly three years. Obviously, this used to be an annual event. And we were very happy to meet everybody. But unfortunately, COVID actually put rest to that for some time. But glad to be back in action in that sense. But its not as though we have not been in touch. We obviously have been in touch, in continuous touch for that matter. We still continue with our roadshows. We meet with all of you on a one-on-one basis or in groups or in the various broking houses that conduct their meets.. So in that sense, we certainly have been in touch. Vinita and Nilesh, of course, focused a lot on FY25 and took you through the strategies that we have for the future. And of course, give you a glimpse of what we intend doing over the next five years and how we are going to achieve our goals. But Im just going to focus on, in fact, the current year, what have we done in this particular quarter. The momentum for the current quarter was, of course, set a few quarters ago. So the last seven to eight quarters have been a period of continuous growth. And thats reflected in the numbers that you see out here as well. This quarter, again, it is great growth across various markets. The good thing about Lupin is the fact that its been secular growth across all markets. And this has come about the kind of products that we have introduced, which, of course, youll see in the next couple of slides. Equally, there has been good performance across all markets. And of course, a lot of focus across various lines. Nilesh and Vinita spoke about various initiatives that we have taken and all of those have borne fruit. Talking about, in fact, this particular quarter, US, of course, we had Mirabegron. We also had other products, like Prednisolone, Rivaroxaban and of course, the inline products of Albuterol, Spiriva®, which delivered. If you talk about the advanced markets in Europe, U.K., Luforbec® continues to do pretty well and of course totalling up pretty good growth. India, this particular quarter, it was seemingly lacklustre but the fact of the matter is we lost exclusivity on a couple of products when it came to diabetes. And of course the respiratory portfolio, the overall market itself has not performed too well. But clearly, if you compare year on year, we have done pretty well there as well. API, of course, the full year, we have done extremely well. The GIB business in API, of course, has done extremely well as well but its a cyclical business in a general sense. The most important story is really on the EBITDA and the last several quarters, we have seen continuous growth. This particular quarter, we ended up at 23.2%, but this is after taking into account a couple of things. The first is, essentially, you would see a INR 100 crore increase when it comes to the R&D expenditure and there has been a decline in terms of PLI that we claimed for this quarter, which is about INR 50 odd crores. So if you would adjust for these two, the actual EBITDA margin would have been close to about 26%. And the other thing that you should certainly take into account is the fact that some of our adjacencies that we started in recent times are still making a loss. Obviously, its a question of time before they also evolve and grow in size in critical mass and of course, contribute to the overall profits. If you were to May 15, 2025 take that into account, that would actually be good another 3.7 % points. So clearly, the EBITDA margins are in line with, in fact, the rest of the competition, the peer group and we have caught on pretty well. For the full year, of course, done extremely well. Last years margins were close to about 19%. Full year FY25, we are moving it at 23.7%. Clearly, the momentum has been maintained and more to come, as Vinita and Nilesh were saying. Clearly, we learn from history and whilst we have come a long way, its also equally important to see the magnitude of change. Lupin peaked way back in 2017-18, when we had products like Fortamet® and Glumetza®, that was a time when the entire industry was also doing pretty well. Lupin is, of course, at its peak. Our market cap was close to about USD 13.5 billion, but since then, a lot of water has flown and you would recognize that the entire structure of the industry changed quite a bit. First, we had the enactment of GDUFA, which changed in lots of ways the industry because there were faster approvals. Second is of course, the channel consolidation which happened in America which of course set us back because it was stacked against the manufacturers. Then of course COVID which struck. We also had our own systemic problems in terms of our five of our facilities were under OAI status and because of that, we were not getting approvals. So whilst we had a pipeline of close to about 109 molecules, we unfortunately were not getting the approvals to launch them and to that extent, the top line was not moving. The actual movement started in 2021 when we got our approvals for Albuterol and since then, the mojo was back. In 2022, we actually brought in a couple of other products also Posaconazole was one of the products. Then of course Brovana®. Brovana® is what we launched in 2022. In 2023, we had products like Xopenex® which came in. We also had Suprep®. In 2024, we had Spiriva® and before that, we had Darunavir and this year of course we have Mirabegron. All of this has brought in a tremendous change when it comes in fact to the top line. But more importantly, what it did was also increasing the gross margins. The quality of the products, it went up over time. Whilst we bottomed at around 58.3, this is the time when we were actually plagued by failure to supply, penalties because of that and of course, returns in America because of Nitrosamine products. All of this was something that we addressed with the team thats out here. And since then, the margins have crept up. The gross margins are now moving up. In 2024, we saw it at 66%. And this year, we closed at 69.2%, big increase over the last several quarters. Whilst we focused on, in fact, the mojo on the top line, bringing in good products, we didnt lose sight of, the various lines across the entire P&L. And as the leaders were saying, theres a lot of work done on every line of the P&L. We looked at the gross margins, in terms of alternate vendor development, routes to synthesis, productivity across various lines in terms of R&D, in terms of manufacturing, in terms of our sales force. All of this actually resulted in fact the expenses that we brought in line. We also undertook a mission to actually bring down cost by close to about, INR 750 to INR 1,000 crores. Nilesh just mentioned the fact that there has been good success in that and we saw the numbers as well. And you could actually see, while in FY20, other operating expenses was about 30.4% and FY21 was the period when you had COVID and there was a reduction in terms of sales and promotion expenses. May 15, 2025 But since then, a lot of the measures that we took have brought these lines back to less than 30%, something that we committed to the investing community some time ago. A lot of emphasis on moving to more complex products and though of course the R&D spends have been increasing as a percentage of sales, it has actually been kept constant around, about 8%. Though of course, you might actually see an absolute numbers and as a percentage of sales going up over the next few years. As a result of all of this, obviously, the EBITDA margins have grown continuously. The analyst community would talk to us and talk about the fact that our margins were less than their peers but we have addressed that. And as I was just telling you, we were at 23.8%, thanks to all of this. And if I were to knock out the impact of, in fact, the adjacencies and one times and the like, obviously, things would be much more. Capital expenditure has been contained. We addressed the footprint and still addressing that as well. A lot of the capital expenditure has already been done, not too much actually happening out there. From that perspective, we also find the free cash flows increasing. Theres been a lot of focus on operating working capital. You know, some time ago, we were the darling of the crowd when we had working capital of less than about 96-97 days. It went up over a time because, we lost sight of that for a period of time. We have addressed this issue and the focus has brought us back to pretty good operating working capital. The operating working capital today is amongst the best in the industry at just about 110. And obviously, all of this is also in much larger free cash flows. We are talking about a figure of about INR 1,330 crores this particular year after taking into account all the amounts that we expended in terms of capital expenditure, the increase in working capital and also in terms of investments for the M&A that we have done. You would be happy to know that we are now a cash surplus company. The overall net debt of the company is virtually zero. The ability to actually raise monies and go for acquisitions is far superior right now. All of this is, resulted in much higher ROCEs, which has been climbing over time. Today, its a good 22%. Still a far cry from what we were about a few years ago. We were 27% - 28%. And its a question of time we get to those levels. We would be looking at M&A because clearly, thats something which is important from our perspective to grow our specialty business. And of course, the growth in India. But clearly, there is a lot of focus on ROCE. We started our ESG journey quite several years ago but we were not articulating that in terms of our annual report. But today, the last three years, weve been to be reporting a lot of stuff in the integrated report and you would find that we have made pretty good progress out there. In terms of various frameworks that are there in existence, we have actually done extremely well. On a DJSI score, we have scored a high of about 75, last year, which is amongst the top three in the industry. We have got a lot of accolades across various frameworks, EcoVadis, in terms of UNGC, in terms of TCFD and May 15, 2025 all of this is reflected in the various metrics that we keep publishing from time to time. In terms of our goals itself, the number of goals that weve taken for FY30. Theres a lot of focus because we are passionate about it. Wed like to actually look at a very differentiated way of presenting this and taking this as in terms of our responsibilities and done a pretty good job there. Some of these are actually mentioned out here. Weve done a lot of stuff when it comes to climate change with, a 23% reduction till date whilst the goal is about 38%. In terms of water, I think we are leading the industry out there. And in recycling, about 50% by FY30. Similarly, there are lot of other goals that we have set and this is something which is very important especially from a European perspective. Thank you, friends. And with that, I think we could just move on to the question-and-answer session.",

And that’s what they are trying to do with this MFN clause, to negotiate pricing on brand drugs at a level similar to Europe. I don’t expect it to get to generic drugs very quickly because, generic drugs are already a pretty low spend. We have emphasized to the government as part of the Section 232 investigation in the commerce department that theres a lot of inefficiency in the supply chain. When you May 15, 2025 look at the generic side of the industry there is only a small percentage of the value that comes to the manufacturer, theres a big part that goes into the GPOs and PBMs and that’s where they need to focus to be able to gain efficiency. I think that is also, resonating with them. They are looking at the numbers and can see that how skewed the value chain is. So, we think that the PBMs are going to be challenged quite a bit. We have already started seeing some of that, a few of the states have already started dis- intermediating PBMs. I think that you are going to see potentially more negotiation with Big Pharma on brands. Again, to be seen how that syncs up with the reshoring goal that the administration has. And I see limited impact on generics.",

      "content": "It has been quite an evolution. The strategy has been evolving on the biosimilars front just given the market evolution. When you look at the changes that have taken place in the US. It is really creating opportunity for older products as well for us. For example, Pegfilgrastim it’s a very old product, multiple players in the marketplace. But as we have had conversations over the last year with the customer base the fact that we will come in with a new ASP that’s attractive for providers makes it a very attractive opportunity. So, we really see value in bringing Pegfilgrastim to market. Whether we do it ourselves or we do it with a partner is a question mark.. We have both options available to us. So, when you look at the other products, if you start looking at the first product that we had invested in was Etanercept - Enbrel®, and the idea with Enbrel® was global, we wanted to get into the US market, European market, everywhere we can and theres a submarine pattern that appeared in the US that held the product back until 2029. But we launched in Europe through Viatris, now Biocon, as well as other parts of the world through other partners. In the US we have the ability to bring the product into the market ourselves in s fiscal year 30. It will be a material opportunity for us because we likely will still be one of four in the marketplace. So, for us so far it has been a learning on the biosimilars front. We have tried to mitigate the risks through partnerships, partnerships on the development cost, partnerships on commercialization. In the last 12 months with the changes in the US we really see an opportunity of going direct into the market with biosimilars. Particularly for products like Pegfilgrastim May 15, 2025 certainly there is an opportunity. But also for the Ophthalmic products - the two products that we have on the Ophthalmic front, Ranibizumab and Aflibercept. we have the relationships with Ophthalmic distributors right now. AmerisourceBergen which is now Cencora is 70% of the ophthalmic market, they visit 70% of the ophthalmic clinics. So, we have the relationships in place to be able to enter that market if we get approval in time and can launch the product. Having said that going forward now given the barriers are reducing it becomes like a complex generic play for us. So, the focus is on products where the number of competitors are limited or where we can be one of few in the market place.",

We can bring synergies through our development lifecycle management within our internal capabilities. So, respiratory definitely is a big focus, building on what we have. And CNS neurology - with NaMuscla®, we are now doing the study to bring the product to US as well, that’s multiple times the opportunity of the current product. If we can get other neurology products, they will be synergistic with the infrastructure that we have in Europe as well as what we will build in the US. Those are still the two focus areas. Opportunistically we look at other areas as well based on the assets that come to market. Our focus is very much on accretive assets; on a limited basis we are looking at pipeline assets. On the pipeline front we obviously want de-risked pipelines, so late-stage programs and will want to look at creative structures around it to be able to mitigate the risk on our P&L. In terms of capital allocation maybe I will let Ramesh talk about it. I mean the overall allocation is the focus is specialty and India region.",

In terms of for example the overall debt that we will take on the balance sheet will be around the 2:1 ratio in terms of Debt to EBITDA .

We are also kind of prioritizing in terms of where we will be putting our money in and from our perspective it is going to be in India and of course specialty. Though we would of course like to address white spaces in distribution program across say geographies like Europe. And we have also said that when it comes to adjacencies, we would restrict our overall involvement to what we envisaged at the time of drawing up the investment program for various adjacencies. Beyond that we would actually involve private equity houses or a potentially strategic of the like. So, we also said in terms of financial returns we would be expecting return of about 20% and in terms of a payback period between 4 to 6 years depending upon the project. So, some of these guardrails are already operational. And going forward we would make sure that most of the projects qualify under this.",
