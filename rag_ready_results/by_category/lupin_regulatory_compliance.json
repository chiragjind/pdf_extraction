      "content": "A very warm welcome to everybody out here; very happy to have you back, especially when the results are so good. Im sure youve already gone through the results and a lot of youve already spoken to me and asked me a lot of questions. Indeed, when we began the year, we said the first two quarters are going to be little lackluster, but we did promise that the third quarter and fourth quarters, youll see a remarkable turnaround and more than that, actually. And we lived up to our own expectations. This fourth quarter, we closed our accounts with a record turnover, over INR 4,000 crores, for this particular quarter. Ive been advised that there are people from abroad joining in, and we have a call. So lets wait for a few more minutes. There are several qualitative aspects to our turnover for the quarter, of course, there is a 9% growth for the full year, when we speak about the performance vis-à-vis the previous quarter that is 22% up, 34% up vis-à-vis the last year itself. While these are a good set of numbers, we are happier with the gross margins performance also; 74% for this particular quarter and if you look at the performance for the year, it is 68.7% while it’s even higher than in the last year. It goes to show the quality of the products we launched in the market fourth quarter. Of course, it follows through with the EBITDA margins - which for this quarter was 34% whilst for the full year it is still a tad lower than the last year, but I would attribute that a very high R&D expenditure over Rs.500 crores, which would have translated another 3 percentage points. If we add both, we come to EBITDA margins even higher than last year. Of course, the PBT, again, despite the fact that the R&D expenditure was high - was higher than last year and if not for that for the higher quantum of tax, the PAT itself would have been considerably high. And on that last note, may I request Dr. KKS to make the presentation? Dr. Kamal K Sharma: Good Evening, Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you, Ramesh for those opening remarks. You’ve already seen the results, and Ramesh gave you a snapshot of where the financials have worked out. I think, I’m going to walk you through some of the industry trends as they are mopping, and how does Lupin that come in the face of those trends, and finally look at the quick dive into the financials, and end by saying as to what we are going to be doing, in the coming years. So, when we speak about the trends, something which has been very prominent in the recent past, is the erosion in prices in the US. And as you are aware that there has been substantial consolidation of the channel partners, and therefore it has obviously helped them to improve their bargaining power and the differential price in that one could earlier enjoy that is no more there. So, there is a block price for a group of channel partners, and I think the last one which happened was recently was Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 McKesson and Walmart, right. So, that really has been -- you know, generally, the US market -- Generic market will experience about 4% to 5% price reduction, of which at least 50% one would be able to make up through operational efficiencies but this particular episode has led to double-digit reduction to the tune of 14-15%. Of course, what is positive, is a better score on approvals by FDA. There has been substantial improvement in that area which had hithered towards deficient. When it comes to India, we are all aware that NLEM has set a new order as far as the Indian business is concerned. And whatever was the impact of the first NLEM policy, there has been further reinforced with what has happened in 2015 and the latest one that we have been dealing with is the ban on fixed dosage combinations, there is a temporary respite for part of them because we have a stay order but how it’s going to pan out is anybody’s guess. In sum and substance, there is a pressure on the business in terms of control on prices and ability to launch new products. Japan - the government has been progressively working towards improving the penetration of Generics, it is targeting 70% by 2017 and 80% by 2020. But on the other side, Japanese administration is also pushing prices down, I think, earlier we used to experience reduction in price every two years, now it’s become an annual feature which is not a very good news. There has been substantial consolidation in the industry in the last 2.5-years; M&A of $500 billion has happened and most of you have been reading in the papers of the major mergers which have taken place in the recent past. Another development which is worth citing here is that Biosimilars which is kind of a new wave in Generic market. They are now seeing a lot of traction on the guidelines, pathways from the regulators in Europe and in America and hopefully in the next few years there would be a lot more clarity in taking these to the markets. There are already instances where US is approving Biosimilars for the market. The year witnessed a lot of penalties from USFDA on the manufacturing plants. And while we have had a stellar record, we did not escape the heat and we will talk about that. Coming specifically to United States. What is in store for us in terms of trends, is that the Generic penetration is expected to rise from the current 88% to 92%. Between now and 2020 there is likelihood of $92 billion worth of patent expiration, which is an opportunity in Generics. This obviously augurs very well for the business. We also understand that the lion share of Generic goes to oral solid dosage forms, and a lot more needs to be done in the alternative forms. And the generic industry despite all the consolidation that we keep hearing about and we keep witnessing remains very Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 fragmented and in that sense if you see the top five operators in generics in the United States have lost their contribution from 55% to 51%, market share has come down. This is what I will say, meaning, when I said that the dominant share is with the Oral Solid Dosage form, in the slide that we see on the screen, you would see that there are 47 players in the OSD whereas as you go to the right of the slide you would see that there are a lesser number of players and there is a lot of concentration in the hands of few. The idea of sharing this information with you is to say that there is a lot of scope to grow in alternative dosage forms other than OSD and that’s what, is the world of Complex Generics and specialty which we’re pursuing in the company. What does this trending mean for Lupin in particular? I think we’ve already started our journey towards Complex Generics, we need to focus on it a lot more, we need to build Specialty both internally as well as through acquisition and partnerships. In India, I think the way the trends are, if we are going to be controlled on new launches, if there’s going to be price pressure, I think, the alternative is to increase your prescriber base and as we have demonstrated in the past we need to create more alliances: a) we need to go deeper into the existing alliances, as I speak with you we have four alliances in India with multinationals, and whatever we are doing with them, we need to go deeper, in addition, b) we need to tie up with more partners, so that the growth is ensured. Likewise in Japan, I think if one wants to deal with the price pressure, the only way it can be done is to launch more products and -- in order to do that I think we need to seek more strategic partnerships and of course we are already undertaking capacity expansion in Japan to be able to serve the market better. As far as M&A is concerned, I think we have stated in the past and our policy remains as we have said in earlier that Lupin would look at select areas of brand and specialty and niche technology platforms when it comes to merger and acquisitions. We’ve also stated earlier about our geographic expansion endeavor and I must say that in future you might witness some bolt-on acquisition, but by and large, as far as the geographic expansion is concerned for the company, we seem to be there, I think what we need to do is really now make these new acquisitions grow and consolidate them rather than expand geographically any further. Derived from the focus on Complex Generics and Specialty, I think it is a natural corollary that the R&D investments have to get enhanced in Complex Generics and the Specialty area and also in Biologics and you already see that escalation happening as we will discuss the financials. Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 As far as the execution is concerned, I think we’ve always revered for flawless execution and operational excellence is one of the key drivers of our effort there. We want to make sure that we are cost leaders in whatever we do. And that brings me to sharing with you, what we have been sharing in the past too as to how we see Lupin mopping, from a Generic - Branded Generic Company till now into Complex Generics, Specialty Company going forward and the share of Complex Generics and Specialty has to increase with the Generic component of the business. Generic would always remain a very lion piece of the business, as you know that, at any given time, very large part of illness is served by patent expired drugs. So one cannot do with that but larger attention would be received by Specialty and Complex Generics in our business. So that’s about the trends that we are kind of witnessing in the industry. In the face of those trends, I think its worthwhile looking at how Lupin stacks up to this challenge. I think one feels very proud to share journey of last 10-years with the audience here. It has been a stellar performance by any standards. If you look at the market capitalization, I think, there’s a compounded annual growth rate of 32% from kind of Rs.41 billion to Rs.667 billion. Revenues have registered a growth of 24% in the same period. R&D expenditure has also gone up with 31% growth and this is something which -- you know, R&D is a key driver of our business endeavor in Pharmaceuticals and therefore requisitely we’ve been investing in the priority areas in R&D. What is most heartening is the quality of our business where you see our EBITDA margins growing at annual compounded rate of growth 29%. There were times when we were struggling around the 10% and you know 18-19% for a long time. We’ve crossed that barrier and we are now around 30%. Likewise, net profit also has shown very promising growth of 29%. So that speaks about the way we have organizationally strengthened our company. As a consequence of that, we are today 7th Largest Generic Company Globally by Market Cap, 9th Largest Company by Revenues, we are the Third Largest Indian Pharma Company by Global Sales, #1 Anti-TB Company which is our Legacy business, we are the 5th Largest Company in the United States by Prescriptions; we have a prescription share of 5.6-5.7%, we are the 9th Largest Generic Company in Japan, 8th Largest Indian Pharma Company and the 4th Largest Generic Company in South Africa and #1 Cardiovascular Company in South Africa. With the good work that the team has done, it has brought along the accolades that the team deserves. The notable ones, that I may mention here in the long list that is in front of you, is being designated as Outstanding Company of the Year by CNBC- TV18, Lupin was ranked as “15th Best Place to Work for in Asia” by Great Places to Work Institute, we have been ranked as one of the best employer of 2016 in India by Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 AON. Vinita Gupta and Nilesh were awarded the Entrepreneur of the year award by Ernst & Young. Vinita has been in the focus for various awards, as you can see the list there and I think the notable one has been the Power 50 Women in Business and last but not the least is Ramesh Swaminathan who has been recognized as The Best CFO by FinanceAsia. When we speak about Lupin today and how it stacks up against the trends and the challenges that I shared in the beginning of the presentation, I think what we are doing with our head down as a team in the company, is to build a global footprint for the company, both through the internal development of capabilities as well as acquiring capabilities from the outside through M&A, wherever we feel either the lead times are going to be very long or we just don’t have the wherewithal from within to build those capabilities. And in that regard, you would see here, that we have set up a state-of-the-art R&D facility in Florida for Inhalation, we have our first Biosimilar order for Pune facility getting into Phase-III Etanercept, we had a stellar launch of Glumetza and a lot of positive movement that we are seeing today is because of that and we hope to continue to do launches like that in future too. On the Inorganic side, we used to hold 60% equity in the South African company, is now 100% ours, so we acquired the 40% remaining equity from the erstwhile promoter, we have acquired a business in Brazil Medquimica, we have acquired Gavis which is our largest acquisition and one of the largest out of India, we also acquired a small CNS portfolio in Germany called Temmler. We’ve always said that you know our inorganic play would be not to chase size but to chase quality. And I think that’s what the slide here would show you that of the entire growth story that Lupin has experienced, 20% of our revenue comes out of inorganic endeavors or inorganic interventions and 80% of that is really our organic effort. So that speaks for the team, as to how well integrated they have been, in terms of achieving the kind of target that we had set for ourselves, which have always been very stretched. And I think another highlight of the journey is that whatever we acquire along the way that too has grown extremely well. So if you see Kyowa that we acquired in October 2007 has registered a compounded annual growth rate of 16% on constant foreign exchange. Likewise the South African asset Pharma Dynamics has grown 25% in the period. So, that shows that whatever we acquired has also been producing results and growing at a very healthy clip. Gavis which is now called Lupin Somerset is our biggest and by far the latest acquisition. And while we were kind of endeavoring to have it by mid of last year, but we could close it only towards the early part of this year, but what is important is that performance is on track, the integration is complete, we have a new leader there, who is an extremely competent person and we hope that whatever we have planned, Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 in terms of tripling the turnover of Lupin Somerset from the time of acquisition, we will definitely be hitting the bull’s eye there. What is even more interesting to share with you that in the portfolio of Gavis, we could get to reach for our Branded business. You know that we are very proud of our Branded business, but for various reasons it had been going down because we lost intellectual property rights on a particular product, it became Generic on Suprax, but these two new leads - one on Methergine which is for Women’s Health and other one, you know, methylphenidate chewable tablets for the Pediatric ADHD indication is giving a new lead to our Branded business and also gives us little more time to really push hard in terms of other efforts that we have been making in building that business. I think you are all aware that in terms of net effect of Gavis on Lupin’s portfolio it has added 28 products to our marketed products, so total 124 products are there in the market today. There are 9 controlled substances and 01 dermatology product out of this basket. There are about 102 cumulative filings, of which 58 are pending and additional 66 products are under development. Lupin has a good score in terms of our total filings; now we have filed, between Lupin and Lupin-Somerset that is our new facility, Gavis, 343 filings, of which 180 have been approved and balance are awaiting approval. What has been more heartening, is that we have total 256 products under development between the two facilities. So that should give you an idea as to how the future is going to pan out with this rich pipeline of products which is getting ready, with 163 awaiting approval and 256 getting into the pipeline. We have spoken about our journey. I think we have been continuously traversing this nexus of complexity where our risk will slightly go up but rewards will substantially go up and you know in business where you have risk, you have rewards. And if you see the chart in front of you, you would see that our journey is defined in the chart starting with Oral Contraceptives. On the right hand side of the chart, you see the total market potential that one is trying to address through this effort and on the left you see the various components of this effort that together constitute riding the wave of complexity as far as the business is concerned. Starting with Oral Contraceptives where we have 21 products in the market, 10 are pending approval. Moving on to Ophthalmology, where we have 2 products in the market, 7 filings are awaiting approval and there are more developments happening; Dermatology, as I said a while ago, we have 1 product from Gavis portfolio and 24 filings, further development is ongoing. And on to Controlled Substances, which is again a very cohesive area for business and we started making efforts in Injectables Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 last two years. We acquired a R&D facility in Netherlands in the name of Nanomi and between LRP, that is Pune facility and Nanomi, will be developing a set of Complex Injectables. We set up this R&D for Inhalation in Florida, which has already made 2 filings; 1 MDI is under clinical trial and we hope to commence trial of the DPI device during this year. And then of course we have a Biosimilars program in India, where we have 10 products under development and one of them Etanercept is entering Phase-III for Japan. And of course, we have a program on new drug discovery where we have 10 new chemical entities, 4 of them are in clinical trials currently. Talking about Global Footprint: I think very rightly we have today manufacturing facilities, 12 sites in India, 2 in Japan, 1 in United States, 1 in Mexico and 1 in Brazil. We also have a research facility in Pune in India. Also, a small research facility in Aurangabad to augment the Generic development. We have research facilities in Japan, one for Injectable, one for Oral Solid Dosage. We have R&D facilities in Somerset and we have also small R&D facilities in Mexico and in Brazil and of course Nanomi in Netherlands. So that’s truly the mark of a global footprint where we have multiple manufacturing organization and multiple research facility to really pool into overall effort of moving up the complexity chain and reaching our target that we have set for ourselves. I said in the beginning that the rigor of inspections have gone up from FDA, for good reasons, at the same time, I think -- for example, - last one year we have faced about 12, so -- and there have been times when two sites are being inspected at the same time, so that would just tell you as to how much extra vigilance is happening in - on this count. We have had a very good record as far as compliance is concerned since 2009, but in the recent past, yes, we also face the heat as I mentioned earlier. The major among these observation has been only Goa where we had a repeat inspection from the FDA, we have responded to the observations and we have provided an update thereafter which is kind of in regular good order and we are now working for a holistic transformation. In a matter of speaking, the transformation is never complete here because the goal post keeps changing, so you have to continuously work to keep on the effort and if at all there is any failing, it is our own failing to live up to certain speed of the target changing. From time to time the prescription from the FDA undergo change, the new employees come, the training needs - need to be augmented and therefore there are times when one has challenges to face, but we are very confident that we are going to be able to deal with it like we did it in the past in 2009. So that, kind of gives you a snapshot of how Lupin today stacks up to the trends and the challenges, as are presented to work in the industry. Now, a quick Business Update for you: Ramesh has already shared this with you, you have the results with you I think, Q4 has been an epoch making quarter for us. It is a record turnover of Rs.4,000 crores plus and a record net profit of Rs.800 crores Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 plus. Obviously, this is riding on major contribution from United States apart from other geographies like India and Japan which have also turned out very good performance. In fact, what is heartening about Lupin is that all geographies have turned out good performance, notwithstanding FOREX pressure in the emerging markets where the local currency has been depreciating, but since US is a lion share of our revenue, obviously, what happens in the US affects our overall results rather more penetratingly either in other geographies. In terms of the annual results, as you know that we started off last year, the first two quarters were under challenge. We spoke about the price pressures in America, we spoke about the NLEM effect you know the price reduction there and in face of all that, we never had any new products in the first two quarters, so one of the ways to combat pressures of prices is really to be able to launch new products, but unfortunately, we had pretty dry spell in the first two quarters, it was from Q3 onwards that we started, you know, getting better; we did a reasonable job in the Q3, but Q4 has been fantastic. Overall, the year witnessed a very moderate growth of 8.7 % in the top line. The net profit appears like recording slight decline of 5.5%; however, we maintain the PBT despite a severe hike in our R&D expenditure. As Ramesh was mentioning to you that this 28.8% EBITDA that you see here is, you give cognizance of the Rs.500 crores extra expenditure that we have done in R&D which is again done for the future, so there is no concern on that account because this is all going towards building IP for the future in terms of clinical development product, but just for the sake of a perspective, if that were to not to be spent, the EBITDA margin will be 32.4%, as against 30.6% of previous year, that will all flow into the PBT line. Adding to that with our unsold inventory and the tax paid on that, our tax rate has been 5% higher than previous year. So all that put together, reflects into what you see is the net bottom line of the company. It is not to justify, it is just to share with you some of the real happenings in the business. Now, talking about some of the Major Geographies -- US: The overall business has shown a growth on corresponding quarter as well as on sequential quarters; 54%. And, this is all in dollar terms as you see on your screen. And as I mentioned that because the first two quarters were absolutely dry for a new product and we’ve done a lot of bucking up in the Q3 and Q4, the year ended up in US as flat. However, there have been some remarkable achievements in the US, as you know that Lupin is a supplier of four of the top ten most commonly dispensed products in United States, we are #5 by Prescription in the US, we have a very handsome pipeline of products as we spoke a while ago with 343 ANDA filings, of which, you know, 180 are approved and Somerset facility has substantially added to that particular portfolio. Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 We had 39 approvals during the year, of which 25 were for Lupin and 14 from Lupin Somerset.",

      "content": "Despite all the pressures has grown 6% over the year. It is 9th largest generic company. You know that it’s a strong company in CNS, Cardiovascular, and Gastroenterology. We’re actually building a new dedicated site for Oral Solid Dosage, also there is a new Injectable line coming up in Japan. In Japan, it is material to have a relationship with national distributors, 4 of them, we have recently got into an alliance with one of the national distributors, we only do some business with 2 of them I think we are now trying to expend on our exposure at the national level. This should augur very well for the company in terms of getting a larger share of the distribution piece. In the rest of the businesses also, as I said, Lupin always has this positive side that we are able to have a secular growth in all our markets. And this is even more meaningful here that what you see on the slide that whatever you see here is despite a pressure on the foreign exchange devaluation in most of the emerging markets. South Africa business has grown 10%, it is the Fourth Largest Generic Company as I mentioned earlier and the #1 Cardiovascular Company. Philippines had a fantastic record of growth of 42% as against industry growth of 9% and is ranked 22nd. Latin America- our Mexican company Lab Grin is the 2nd Largest Ophthal Company by Volume but the 4th largest by revenue. And Brazil, which is Medquimica, is rather new in our system, so we have just to see as to how it mops up, we obviously have plans to grow that business. Europe did well this time; Hormosan, which had been giving us some concerns at times was rather going up and down, we definitely see very clear signs of turning around, it’s now making profit and as I mentioned earlier, Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 we also have acquired a company Temmler which adds to the CNS portfolio of Germany. API business is the strong pillar for Lupin because it feeds all our formulation endeavors. We’ve had a certain slowness in the growth because we have an old portfolio but a lot of new initiatives have been taken in API in terms of adding new line of therapy, new line of APIs, those are going to mop over next two to three years. What is even more heartening that now the API business is going to participate in advanced markets, as you see here, there are 172 US DMF filings, 16 of which were made in this particular year and once they come up, you obviously see a high quality business being added to this portfolio, so that should augur extremely well for the API business of the company. I think we have spoken about R&D that as we move up the complexity curve, I think there is little choice, but to put in more money in R&D, because as you get into the world of Complex Generics and Specialty, Biosimilars, New Drug Discovery of course, there is a lot more clinical development that we have to do and that takes in a lot of money. So as you would see that over last year -- in this year- our R&D expense has gone up by 3%. Just in Q4, the R&D investment was 12.5% of our sales, but you also saw the pipeline that we are developing for future and it takes all that to really be able to bring that to reality. At the same time, I think one is very conscious of the fact that when we are investing in R&D, we need to make sure that our research pipeline really delivers. We continue to invest a lot of money and time in building a good pool of people in addition to what we have in India, as you know now, we have also very strong R&D in United States and the other geographies, where we today have acquired businesses. We’ve already shared the pipeline, so I’m not going to repeat that here. So, having looked at the industry trends, having shared with you as to how does Lupin stack up to those trends, then a quick pen picture of how the financials have come through over the time is now you know - is now to leave you with what are we going to be doing in the company and you see some of the key buckets here for our future endeavors. Very clearly, in Generics, I think we have to grow US and Japan by new launches and grow base business, increase penetration in emerging markets, that’s very clearly the objective. When it comes to Specialty, we have to continue and reinforce our effort to build Specialty both organically as well as inorganically and we are in the process of building a Specialty pipeline. As far as R&D is concerned, I think the task is cut out because in Pharmaceuticals business there are two drivers - key drivers of the business. I sometimes like to add the third one. The R&D on one hand, Marketing the second and maybe Operational Excellence which becomes overriding, rest everything else is a Service function if you really look at Pharma. So R&D is a Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 lifeline of our business and we will continue to deliver on the pipeline and we will evolve the Complex Generics and Specialty pipeline over time, the effort has already started showing up, you will see that in coming quarters. I said that a while ago Operational Excellence, Cost Leadership, High Efficiency, Optimal Time Cycles is the order of the day. You have to remain lean and I think that’s what our endeavor is as far as operational excellence is concerned. Compliance is going to remain a major challenge in our business and we all understand that if you’ve hooked for non- compliance, what it can cost you and therefore that would always remain an area of high interest. With that, I come to an end of my presentation. Thank you very much. I think we can now take questions and we will deal with the questions as they come. Do you have some? Okay, Alpesh is saying that we will have questions from the live audience and alternatively also with the connected audience.",

So good part of growth for fiscal year ’17 is our existing portfolio and then the new product, we certainly are looking forward to new product approvals despite our challenges at Goa, we hope to be able to resolve the 483 with FDA. Proactively we have started tech transferring the materials products that we expect to launch in fiscal year ’17 to our other approved sites to Indore to Aurangabad and to Somerset. Then, we go through the Gavis portfolio, then we have a very nice site - Generic portfolio that we have added in March with the acquisition of Gavis, we see the potential of expanding share on the Generic side of the portfolio, Gavis had a reasonable share but we have stronger reach, stronger relationship with the customers, that should enable us to expand share. And lastly, the growth on the Brand side of the business, the last year - last -- last year was really challenging for our Brand business, we saw Generic Suprax right at the start of the year - you know in April that for us our whole Brand business down significantly to $45 million this last year. When this year with the restructuring of our commercial infrastructure plus the addition of two products - our Gavis and particular Methergine - we see the Brand business getting back to a reasonable level of revenues. We had two products as Dr. Sharma mentioned Methergine and chewable Methylphenidate that Gavis was sole source on that we believe could benefit from promotion. So, we took our sales force 120 people from Pediatric, Primary Care split to Pediatric Women’s Health and Primary Care and have started calling on the hospitals of kinds with Methergine, and they have got very good initial response. Likewise, we added Methylphenidate, chewable Methylphenidate source on to the Brand side, the Pediatric portfolio and have started promoting in and again we started seeing a ramp up scripts with chewable Methylphenidate. So really I mean a lot of our growth focus is the products that we have launched in the last year, the products that we have acquired and there is opportunity on the Brand side of the business that we leverage out of the Gavis portfolio and new products additions out of India as well as of Somerset.",

They have good number of applications that they’ve got approval for the past year, not all of which have been launched, so we expect this year to be a significant year out of Somerset for the organization. On the longer-term aspiration that we have shared you know the fiscal year ’18 aspiration now it doesn’t look like it’s that long-term, it’s year -- next year after this fiscal year we believe based on the initiatives that we have executed on the acquisitions that we have made organic growth efforts, the pipeline that we have for the US, Japan, India, other parts of the world that we can get to $3.5 million or thereabout, I mean, our aspiration was certainly to get to $5 billion but we think based on the current market scenario in the US on the Generic side of the business, based on what we have seen in the emerging market with currencies that we will likely get to $3.5 million where we sit right now. Of course, as we continue to work on other inorganic efforts in particular to build a Specialty business, first, that is what we - what we see right now, we still have an aspiration to grow beyond that, but we think it’s probably till we -- may be a year after or 2-years be on fiscal year ’18, and like Dr. Sharma said that we have never been on the mind set of acquiring to gain scale, you know, our effort has been to gain capabilities and strategically to our Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 business, we will continue to be focused on driving efforts both organically and inorganically to get to that $5 billion number as soon as we can, but through efforts that - that meet our strategy - that fit our strategy.",

The other repeat inspection that you probably saw was for Indore. What we have done at Indore is that we have actually -- we have three registrations in Indore, it’s actually not considered one location as far as the FDA is concerned and that’s why the FDA would come for each of those, so they came for if I am not mistaken all three in the last 18-months or certainly for two and then probably come for the third one as well. In the Goa observation itself, while at the face of it some of them seems similar to some of the observations, there are no repeat observation as such. Pointedly, if there were repeated observations we would have been pointed out as such obviously they were by the classification some of them fall in similar bucket, stuff like cleaning or validation Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 processes and adherence to SOPs.

I am very confident about the product, this product already has translation, and when I say translation that particular product is in chronic kidney disease and bone metabolism, there is only one product ever approved globally and this product is a very differentiated product, not been a follow on addressing much larger population. So we’re very actively looking for - for that product and we have already demonstrated translation in that product for the final approval end point.

We filed 10 ANDAs in the last quarter even. So, I think we are not compromising the number of products. I think what is happening over time is that the regular generic portfolio is starting to reach that steady state where we are seeing steady number of filings, there is steady amount of spend connected to that as well. Obviously, a little bit of the funding is kicking in for us such as Etanercept. So that is helping as well. And on the Novel Lupin Limited October 30, 2017 Research front,, of course, we have scaled down specifically the discovery efforts. So that is cutting out part of the spend as well.

We expect to complete the Phase-III trial with Spiriva this fiscal year and file soon after and continue to work on other inhalation products. Our Advair development, we had additional studies that we needed to do. So that has taken us a little bit longer and then we have other MDI products that we are pursuing on the inhalation front. In terms of the guidance from the FDA, they have said that they are going to be very open to pre-filing meetings, mid-cycle reviews. So really more transparency, more communication around the inhalation products and we really welcome that; the industry welcomes that. But given that we have invested a lot on inhalation front, we expect to be at the forefront of engaging in a dialog with the FDA to try to get these products approved sooner rather than later.",

So, the biggest part of it is really Tamiflu, followed by the Metformin volume decline that we have seen in the last two quarters after Metformin lost its preferred formulary status on PBMs. The third, as Ramesh mentioned was Methergine going generic. So, we had the confluence of both in the generic side of the business as well as the brand side of the business - the impact of the decline in the Metformin franchise in terms of the market volume, few products drop off and Methergine going generic.",

On the realization front, we have got quite a few good products lined up for approval, this particular year we will get at least a couple of products, but next year onwards for example, we are looking at ProAir and then Spiriva, a host of complex injectables coming up and there is Solosec which is obviously going to be a good contributor to the margins. When it comes to the R&D spends, we have been trying to keep it as low as possible and this particular quarter you would appreciate that it is just about 10% of sales. This is a function of two things: we are increasing the productivity of the people associated with R&D and the second part is that we are also tied up with the financial investors who take away the risk from us whilst we share in the upside when we get to launch the product itself and that lowers the overall R&D spends in our books. When it comes to the cost initiatives, it is something that has been going on for quite some time. We have implemented it in a number of ways - there have been initiatives on the procurement front, there have been initiatives on labor rationalization using MOST Lupin Limited August 09, 2018 techniques and the like, pursuing excellence on the operational front and so on. All of these have contributed in the past and will continue to do so. There is also a fresh leash of initiatives that we will be bringing in due course with the help of top tier consultants and all of this will also bear fruit.

Parallel to that we also developed an overall enhancement plan which we have shared with the FDA as well, that really is the multi-year plan in any case. Next step now is to connect with the FDA, likely meet with them, share with them what we have done to-date and following that would be a re- inspection. Earlier, we had talked about resolution by the end of the year, so we should hopefully be able to clear both facilities before the end of the fiscal.",

Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing ‘*’ then ‘0’ on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Lupin Management. Thank you and over to you. Dr. Kamal Sharma: Good afternoon, friends. Its my pleasure to connect with you once again for the quarters performance. Before I give you a brief outline, let me introduce my colleagues who are around the table. We have Vinita, Nilesh, Ramesh, and Alok Sonig - who recently joined us as the CEO of US Generics. We also have Sunil, Rajeev Sibal, Naresh, Rajiv Pillai and Arvind. So, we are all here to answer your questions. You would have already seen the results for the quarter. We have been speaking over last few quarters that there have been very challenging times especially in the US. However, it appears like semblance of stability is now slowly coming in. It is slow but steady and we do hope to see further improvement in the coming quarters. As regards the performance, you would have noticed that the sales have grown on a sequential basis and are flat on corresponding YoY basis. Our EBITDA margin stayed around 20% this quarter at 20.1%. We have been guiding to 18% to 20% EBITDA margin for the year and I think the team is confident that we would maintain that during the year. Also, I think some of the pressure that we saw in the Glumetza and Fortamet franchise is slowly getting addressed now with stability coming in the market on prices and the growth in business. To take you through some of the details of the financials, I will hand over to Ramesh who will share with you the financial analysis of the results.",

So very little of Levothyroxine sales in this quarter, but next quarter onwards and the next full year, we should have the full impact of Levothyroxine sales actually ramping up as we get approval against the other two RLDs on the bioequivalence. So on the generic side of the business, of course, Ranexa is exclusive for a short period of time. After that we expect Levothyroxine to fuel the generic business growth, and then later in the year we also expect ProAir to get approved hopefully. Once we get ProAir approved, we expect to launch it later in the year. Really the generic business has turned the corner this past quarter and with the near-term growth drivers, along with other smaller launches - we are looking at 20 launches next year, we should be able to grow the Generic business.",

We are still in the ramp-up mode and I think we have taken half of what we have targeted so far and continuing to work towards building up share in the product.

One of the initiatives that I talked about was a much deeper transformation, a much deeper quality transformation that Lupin Limited February 06, 2020 we have started at our Indore site. Again, that is our biggest solution over time, that I think it addresses everything that you can think of. Obviously, investigations to start with, which is a relatively hot button for Lupin and the industry, but also areas like training, SOP simplification. Weve made very good progress at our Indore site, where we have piloted this program. The program is basically scheduled to complete by March. We are now starting to roll out the program to our other sites. And specifically, theres a rollout to Goa next week. The intention really is, especially at a site like Goa and our Somerset site to work for the next 2, 3 months on some of these remediation efforts so that we feel really good about the status of these sites. Theres a lot of stuff weve already started, but we want to do a concentrated piece of work for the next 3 months and then offer them up for reinspection. So, Goa and Somerset in the course of the next 3 months, the hope would be to go back to FDA and offer them up for reinspection. As we had shared before, the FDA is okay with us putting up one site at a time rather than as you know, Goa and Pithampur were under one warning letter. We dont have to do both sites together. Were going to offer one site at a time, get them ready, make sure that we feel really good about these sites. Its been long. We are not happy about the fact its been multiple sites. We are not happy about that also. But we have a really clear plan at this point of time. Weve also strengthened our team significantly. Weve talked in the past about hiring a Head of Compliance, a Head of Investigations, but weve also made a lot of efforts. Weve got Johnny Mikell to head our quality and compliance function. He is based in the U.S., but he is spending all his time in India, of course. But we are also augmenting the capabilities of the team further because the more we do this, the more we realize that at each site, manufacturing and quality is where you need the right solid positions. I mean, wherever we find weaknesses, we are augmenting those. There are 2 or 3 sites, where weve already done those. There are a couple of more sites where we still want to address that as well. So that quality is sustainably built into the products that we make. This is a lot of good positive stuff. Obviously, we feel very energized about that. Obviously, none of it is reflected in outcomes at this point of time, but the plan is in the next 3 months to go back to FDA and basically, in the next 6 months, come back to you guys to report good news on this.",

We believe that the agency is very keen on getting products to the finish line. But we have to still traverse that path. We have to get product approvals to start monetizing it. Obviously, we are working very closely with the agency to make that happen. You mentioned facility, of course, is make or break. We are very cognizant of that as well. But as we look at some of these areas right now in the near term, you look at inhalation, which is important part of our growth driver in the next couple of years. And specifically look at the product filings, whether its albuterol in the U.S., Fostair in Europe, Spiriva in the U.S. and the facilities they are from like Pithampur Unit 3, which has gone through FDA inspection, gone through European inspections, and we feel good about the ability to get approved for these products and supply out of there. Likewise, on the biosimilars front, which, again, is a material growth driver in the next couple of years, we have received approval in Japan, we have received approval in Australia. Expect that we should be able to get product approval also in Europe and then U.S., of course, for pegfilgrastim and other products in the future. Over the last couple of years, there have been a lot of learnings along the way.

So if you could just probably call out some of these drivers, so which take us back to 18%-plus margins on a sustainable basis that will be really helpful because as of now, Im not saying that you guys wont be able to do it, but it doesnt look that easy.

We are very hopeful to get albuterol approval soon. We have had strong interaction with the agency, especially in the last couple of months and hope to bring it to market a little bit sooner than we had stated in the past. That should be another very good driver.",

But I think the momentum is to continue and we are aligned with FDA in that, everybody wants supply continuity, everybody wants facilities that are compliant to be up and running. Were working with the FDA; weve made a lot of progress at sites. Somerset, we have already put up for re-inspection, Goa & Pithampur, both of these are possibly in the next month going to be ready for re-inspection. And were going to really work with FDA to see what the best way would be. I dont think theres a stated remote virtual audit process. There is certainly a document review process, there is a mutual recognition process as well. Well have to push the envelope and see what the best way will be to do it. But, again, from our own internal development, theres a lot of strength, which has been built on the compliance front. And we certainly expect to take this to the finish line.",

While it has not increased over the last couple of years, there is significant remediation cost, especially some of the third-party consultant work, for example in Mandideep where we have a warning letter. So, those costs are ongoing. They are actually lower with COVID because everything is being done only remotely. We are now selectively reexamining, if you go deeper into our compliance issues, one of the big areas was investigations. I think weve been able to now start inspiring confidence in our actions on the investigations front and that gives us the opportunity on what is the best way to structure this, so that we take more of an internal lead rather than a third party lead for some sites. Other sites where we feel that we still need to have input, we continue to do that. Were relooking at the scope of third-party work. Were examining that very closely at this point of time. I would see a decline this year versus last year and then going forward it should come down even more.",

So, for the next fiscal year, its these 3 products in the U.S. - Albuterol, Perforomist, Brovana and Fostair in Europe. In the following year, we would expect Spiriva as well as Dulera, hopefully.

On the peptides, we are making progress as well, getting ready to file a couple of products in the next few months and likewise on the iron colloid products as well. So, we have come a pretty long way on the complex injectables. On the biosimilars front apart from Etanercept, we made really good progress on Pegfilgrastim.

But that being said, it is what it is, and we have to be able to deal with it. Clearly, there were areas for improvement in Somerset. I wouldnt generalize that for the rest of the operations, because we have a pretty bespoke kind of plan for each facility, as we gear up remediation activities. For example, you saw in the past that Mandideep had a significant number of observations, which eventually went to a warning letter. There we have a very deep transformation program. In Pithampur too, weve had a very deep transformation program. Not the same way in Goa or Tarapur even for that matter. So, I wouldnt generalize across the board. Obviously, there is a deeper transformation that is being conducted right now in Somerset as well. There were specific areas of improvement there. Some of the things that happened there do not happen elsewhere. But I think, suffice it to say that this is one of our biggest priorities to get it right. As you know, we had a very solid start in 2020 in the first calendar quarter we got the EIRs for 6 facilities, and still being cited for some of the observations that we have been cited for in the past. So, were moving in the right direction. Job is not done. Theres still work to be done on the compliance front.",

We believe that this will be the way. I think its a big positive that theyve come up with this guidance and it really is applicable for everything. It is for surveillance, its for OAIs where CAPAs are complete and PAIs as well.

In addition to the surveillance inspections, just all the other inspections which are for-calls. From our perspective, we had a great start last year up to March where we had six consecutive positive outcomes out of FDA inspections. They cited some of the observations which have plagued us for a while, like investigations as well, and yet we received the EIRs and satisfactory closures. Weve worked a lot, especially on some of the India sites, like Pithampur Unit- 2, lesser so in Goa and Tarapur because there wasnt a deeper fix that we wanted to put in place. We would welcome the flow of inspections to restart. As you know, I think were over-indexed on the number of sites which are at some degree of non-satisfactory compliance. It is a clear organization goal that we have to overcome those. May 13, 2021",

      "content": "Thank you Dr. Sharma and Good evening friends. I trust that you and your families are keeping safe. In a quarter that was impacted by pressures in the US, we are pleased to deliver 22.2% growth YoY and 12.7% growth QoQ, bolstered by US$50 million milestone received from Boehringer Ingelheim in this quarter. Business without the milestone income grew by 11.4% YoY and 2.8% QoQ. QoQ growth was driven by our India business that grew 27.2% and Growth Markets that recorded 9.7% growth. Indian market grew 39.2% including COVID therapies and 32.4% excluding these. The acute market grew 52.5% and we grew 45.4%. The chronic market grew 19.4% and we grew 22.6%. HCP attendance is back to 90% levels and patient footfall is 77%. Our call average is 9.6. We see high-teens growth in India for the year overall. US revenues were down sequentially due to competitive pressures on some of our base business products, famotidine in particular, as new competition entered. Additionally, there is an element of failure to supply due to supply chain issues that cropped up last year and that we have settled with our customers currently. Further, for our Albuterol generic, we’re transitioning from spot buying to long-term contracts. Albuterol is ramping up nicely and based on our commitments, it is on track to get to 18% - 20% market share with a major pickup in Q3. Brovana AG has been a successful launch in the quarter and we expect it to contribute to growth in the current year. We August 11, 2021 remain committed to grow our US business, both with our in-line products as well as ramp-up of Albuterol and Brovana AG, continue above market growth in India and of course ensure growth in every part of the business. We feel extremely good about our NCE efforts and we are exploring ways to better fund the path forward, including a potential spin out. Coming to margins, gross margin as a percentage is down to 63.9% due to change in reporting of partnered products in the US. Royalties on partnered products were reflected in the SG&A, manufacturing and other expense line earlier and is now reflected in the gross margins line itself. On a net basis partnered products are EBITDA accretive. Gross margin was also impacted by change in sales mix, so far as India vis-a-vis America is concerned. US margins were lower this quarter, driven by increased competition and slower ramp- up of Albuterol. Whilst the quarters profits were bolstered by Boehringer Ingelheim MEK program income, despite a tough operating environment, we see substantial room for growth. Employee cost was up vis-a-vis our Q4, primarily due to increments in India and higher sales incentives for IRF given the significantly higher sales in this quarter. Q4 last year was also significantly lower given certain incentive reversals in India. Amongst our peer set, we’re the only ones that were able to bring down the manpower cost down as an absolute number in FY 21. We intend to maintain tight control on this line, while ensuring growth for the future. Manufacturing and other expenses were down 8% QoQ. This was partly because of the reclassification of partnered products royalty into COGM, as I spoke before. Promotion expenses went up because of increased business, especially in India. R&D expenses were 9.7% of sales and we expect to hold this number tightly without losing out on opportunities. EBITDA without NCE income and forex loss stood at 14.3%, a level that we are not happy with at all, after the EBITDA improvement that we delivered through the quarters last year. We see meaningful uplift in the second half and remain focused on journey of expanding margins, by driving strong double-digit revenue growth and optimizing on cost, whilst ensuring the safety of our people and the highest standards of compliance. While we see our business in particular in the US, improve quarter after quarter based on Albuterol and Brovana AG ramp up and stabilizing base business, we have embarked on accelerating additional optimization efforts across our manufacturing and supply chain, including tackling idle cost for product categories where the demand has dropped. We are looking at finding solutions for areas like specialty, biosimilars and NCE, including spinouts. Whilst we are not happy with our performance, we remain committed to improve our business throughout this fiscal. We expect revenues to grow in the double-digits, both in India and in other parts, including America and EBITDA to be 17% to 18% in the second half, which is lower than our earlier August 11, 2021 guidance of 19% to 20%. We see meaningful bounce back in the second half, driven by increased sales in Albuterol, higher base in India and growth across various markets. With this, may I open the floor for the discussions.",

One major event was Econdisc broke out of the WBAD consortium to independently run their GPO and open their whole portfolio to a bid. So that really got companies aggressive from a pricing standpoint. Second, because of the FDA slowdown of inspections and therefore approvals, we August 11, 2021 have seen more competition on existing products than approval of new products. Third Id say, some of the new wave companies that have gotten in whether it’s Alkem, Alembic, others, they have gotten more aggressive in trying to get share at pretty low pricing. So, its a combination of a couple of different things. Overall, just given the challenges that our customers also had this past year because of COVID. Theyve been trying to really make up for it in terms of the losses that they had, the margin loss they had by trying to really gain on the generic front. Overall, as we look at our product mix, when we look at the last couple of quarters before Q1, with the ramp up of new products that offset older products, one feels pretty good about the ability to continue to increase both revenues and margins. In this quarter, there have been a few unanticipated events. Also, from our perspective, the transition on Albuterol has taken a little bit longer, albeit fairly confident of the ramp up.",

Both are on track despite couple of months of delay due to COVID, but still on track for filing in terms of this fiscal year as well as next fiscal year. Were also making progress on our peptides as well as the iron colloid product out of India. I would request Nilesh to elaborate.",

That’s really taken away the litigation risk. Weve got a very favorable date that we will look forward to disclosing in the future. We are working right now towards getting the product approved. We recently responded fully to CRL that the agency had raised. Expect to get approval in the next calendar year. So, that should be a material growth driver in the near future. We continue to make progress on other pipeline programs like gDulera, and we have gFlovent, gSymbicort, gQvar in our pipeline. We also have the next wave platforms - ellipta device that we have developed in- house and are developing programs on the device.

      "content": "Were pretty happy with where we are with the biosimilar portfolio to date. Funding has been a concern and it has been a part of our story so far. Our lead October 28, 2021 product was Etanercept, which is approved in Japan and Europe. One day it will come to the U.S. when the patent expires. Our first lead product to the U.S. is peg-G, which we filed. Its going through the review process nicely. We dont see any showstoppers right now. A key milestone is going to be a likely inspection of the facility, theres some to and fro on when that might happen. The next product is ranibizumab, which is in development. Theres a global clinical trial underway, ran slower on account of Covid, but again we hope to ramp that up going forward. There are 2 - 3 new products which are in the earlier stages of development in the pipeline as well. With the way that Lupin is able to fund this, obviously there is a constraint on how many of these projects we can finance. Vinita talked last quarter about a spinout of, one was the oncology, the second was likely the biosimilars, the third was also taking care of the specialty expense. So, weve done the specialty expense. Were on the way on the oncology spin out as well. The biosimilar spinout is certainly something that stays on the table as a discussion item. We do hope to be able to action that. I think that would free up the way for a lot more portfolio expansion, not necessarily waiting for a funding partner to tie up on a project-by-project basis and it will give a lot of latitude to development. But in the meanwhile, we cherry pick. We do 2 or 3 products at a point of time, likely 1 or 2 products in the clinic. At any point of time, we have great capability on the R&D, manufacturing, drug substance, drug product side, on the regulatory side. There is great capability to be used globally as far as biosimilar is concerned. It is going to be a good growth opportunity. But I think the financing story has to still play out.",

We have other products that we are still focused on Europe, but the opportunity is really in the U.S. We will definitely look at investments to effectively commercialize and start our biosimilars business in the U.S. effectively and really calibrate it versus the opportunity. We also have a follow-on for pegfilgrastim, the Onpro biosimilar. Were going to have both pegfilgrastim as well as the Onpro biosimilar. Theres going to be a timing gap. We will assess whether it make sense to try to club them together to be able to leverage the commercial investment or launch pegfilgrastim ahead of the on-body product. We hope that we have the opportunity to launch next fiscal year. Like Nilesh mentioned, its going to depend on the inspection. The agency has already informed us that they will have to inspect the site. Well wait for that milestone to pass and then determine the right timing to set up commercial infrastructure. October 28, 2021 Ill also say that the commercial infrastructure for biosimilars has synergies with our injectables institutional portfolio. We are simultaneously building our injectables portfolio as well, both internally through our pipeline as well as through partnerships, through in-licensing. Well determine the exact timing to be able to really get an effective portfolio as we enter the market, both with pegfilgrastim as well as the institutional products.",

I shared earlier today that we feel that the observations are very readily addressable. We in our first update would address 6 out of the 7, and the last observation would take maybe a month or 2 more. But we feel very good about addressing these observations comprehensively for Goa as well as for all of Lupin. I do think that we are moving ahead. I dont like the fact that we had 7 observations, but like I said, these are very addressable. Were very conscious that we have to demonstrate with outcomes as far as what we do on the regulatory side. So, were hoping that we should be able October 28, 2021 to close the Goa inspection successfully. Were ready for inspections at our other sites like Pithampur and Tarapur. FDA has now sporadically started inspections in India. Obviously, these sites will get inspected at some point in the next few months or quarters to come.",

I mean, we have, from optimization standpoint worked on multiple areas so far the right sizing the U.S. team as well as looking at any other areas of revenue or profit leakage, whether its FTS or returns and write-offs. A big part of operating leverage is also going to come from plants which, right now are due to all of the challenges that we have had in the last couple of years with OAIs and the fact that new product launches have struggled. We see that the idle cost in the plants have dont have gone up significantly and has really burdened the P&L quite a bit. But with the efforts that we have underway on the optimization in idle cost as well as continued increase in volumes from the products, that now with Goa having cleared the FDA this last quarter, we expect seven launches out of Goa, not big launches, not like Suprep and Spiriva, but still contributing to revenues and reducing idle costs on top of our optimization efforts on plant overheads and idle cost.

      "content": "Thank you for that question, Prakash. So, we obviously feel very good about the change in status of the Goa site. I think we have warning letters started with Goa, so its only fair that they should end with Goa, heralding that. I think, youre absolutely right, I think the issues that had in Goa were similar to what has been sighted in the past as well. And I think, Im very glad that the agency seems to have noted the steps that weve taken. And I dont think were done with that. I think we see that were clearly on the right path, especially as far as investigations are concerned. And that is the same system that they would see at any of our other sites as well. February 4, 2022 Obviously, each inspection is different, its a different set of investigators who would come, we already know that there is not going to be remote audits. So, I think Omicron has played a little bit of spoilsport on the inspections. So, I think its possibly a few months before which you can expect predictably inspection starting again. And but were ready, as far as Pithampur is concerned, or Tarapur is concerned. Were ready. Its the same system in those obviously we remediated on the other items that were highlighted in the past. So, I feel much more confident. The confidence that I get from our team is much more. I think our team did it well, clearly Goa points that were moving in the right direction. And then now we would want to get even better at things like investigations and what we already are. So, I think were moving in the right direction. We have a stated goal in the next 18 months to clear all our sites. And I hope that were going to be able to deliver on that.",

There will be a burn increase, but theyll be more than commensurate increase in the Indian region profitability, that would happen anyway. On Goa, we already had one approval as you know, and that product is getting launched shortly. There are another 6-7 products that we would expect to get approved in the upcoming fiscal and those will get launched as well. And then, I think this approximately about 20 products that are still pending from Goa. On the idle cost, first of all, idle cost is never going to be zero. It obviously needs to be optimized. What has happened right now is demand is significantly down for multiple product categories, the Cefs, for example, both API and finished products for some of the other products as well. And I think that is accentuating the idle cost right. Obviously, the other part is sum of the capacities that weve created for new growth drivers, which are not kicked in. So injectables, for example, which is still not inspected, biotech where its still not adequately utilized. So, those would add to the item idle cost as well. And part of our optimization is going to be increase in revenues of some products to optimally utilize our capacities. But the other is actually going to be workforce planning around some of the plants as well, where we dont see meaningful uptick over time. And that is something that we are expecting to close in the next three to four months after which youll start seeing benefits of that.",

      "content": "Now, its been four years since I last met with investors from Lupin. So I was really looking forward to meeting with you today. I hope you and your relatives, your family have been keeping safe during this time. The last couple of years have been pretty bad for a lot of families. I hope you have been doing good. Of course, I have been in touch with people about our performance. Youve been posing questions to me from time to time. And of course, we have had our regular investor calls like every quarter and you have already supported us, guided us, assisted us and we should be looking at things and so on. Thank you for that. Again, coming back to the current year performance, happy to take you through our quarterly performance as well as our results for the year itself. Its a smaller crowd out here, but Im sure there are lot of people who are on the call itself, who would potentially be asking us questions because as per the SEBI regulation, I think we need to be live for the rest of the community to interact with us. So I really would be looking forward to questions from those people who are online, so to speak. And Im happy to take this again. So, well begin with the presentation. So, this is our strategic vision. Next slide, please. Go on to the slide after that. This is our strategic vision for us as a company: a global pharma company focused on core growth platforms. As you recognize, we have done extremely well in India over time. As I listened to a lot of you, you have also been telling me that you should really be focusing on India. And just about a few minutes ago, it was very surprising because sort of people are telling me, as I was listening to them, that India is -- your valuation has been captured in India per se, and the rest of the business has not actually been valued. And to that extent, it is surprising in some ways. Im sure there are going to be a lot of questions about some of the parts and how we could take this forward, so theyre talking to me about that. And so we are looking at India very, very seriously, both organic and inorganic growth. And as weve recognized, weve done a stupendous job out here. And we just acquired recently Anglo-French because thats the way forward for a host of products in the years to come as well. As with a lot of other pharma companies, we are also acquiring assets and focusing on a lot of -- number of platforms. So a lot of complex, really complex ones. I spoke about it a few minutes ago also about the fact that we are concentrating so much on complex injectables, on our inhalations portfolio. And let me add biosimilars. And the fact that OSD business is not going to be the focus area. And thats resonated with you as well. From a global perspective, we believe that we need to be absolutely focused on efficiency. There are number of initiatives that we are taking to make ourselves a lot more efficient because there has been tremendous inefficiencies that have crept into the system over the last few years. But we are conscious of that, and were taking all steps to kind of work on that. May 19, 2022 We are also building operating leverage in our CapEx spend, as well as on R&D. Of course, the overall focus would be to really focus on product development cycles for development and to kind of compress that so that we are delivering top-notch launches from time to time. So, it actually helps in leveraging our top line, a continuous improvement culture, sentient culture, if you may. And of course, the global quality class. All of these, of course, are initiatives that weve taken and were really going to focus on. You would like to add to that, Vinita, if you may?",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. So, this is about the industry trends. Youve also noticed that price erosion seems to have become endemic and so far as the American business is concerned. And we spoke about it just about a few minutes ago. In January, in particular, for example, we saw a 7% decline, whilst it accelerated to 16%. You cant obviously take one brush and kind of paint everything across the entire landscape. But the fact is there is -- its really going to be product specific, portfolio specific, but it is there to stay. The second thing that seems to be confronting everybody is secular inflation, inflationary trends across all sectors, across the pharmaceutical sector as well. This obviously puts pressure on our overall margins. And thus, obviously have been perhaps, again, there is tremendous need for looking at low intensity competitive launches. And many times I just spoke about the fact that were going to focus on, in fact, inhalations portfolio, the complex injectables, the biosimilars and possibly even on the OSDs, niche launches, not actually capture what do you think is going to be value for customers as well as for our investors. India business will remain strong. Its always been our focus for several years, and you have seen us grow in strength from time to time. It will certainly be extremely important for us May 19, 2022 going forward as well. So, it will be -- it will encompass both organic as well as inorganic strokes. And the good thing about getting out of Covid is the fact that the FDA would begin worldwide inspections. And with that, it could be a double-edge sword. It could work in our favor because we have a pretty decent pipeline stuck without approvals. But it could also turn to be a double-edge sword and that it could also intensify competition, so to speak. This is where Lupin is today from a market cap perspective. Next slide, please. Its about $4 billion market cap and revenue base is about $2.2 billion, EBITDA about $311 million. People are very familiar with this. Globally, we are the 10th largest generic company. We were higher up the league tables a few years ago, and we are sure we will get back there. The sixth largest Indian pharma company, the third largest in American from a prescriptions perspective. And we are present in several geographies from U.S.A., Mexico, Brazil, India, and we are present in Australia, Philippines, South Africa and a host of other places. Our overall manufacturing footprint is about -- weve got about 15 sites spread across India. And of course, we have plants in America, in Brazil and Mexico. And we have 7 R&D sites, again, across various parts of the globe. Next slide, please. This is a snapshot of what we actually -- how we -- Q4 actually was for us. As you can see, if you look at our performance over the last four quarters, it generally has been ranging between INR3,800 crores and INR4,000 odd crores. Q4, there was actually a decline versus Q3. This was led by, in fact, a slight reduction in India and of course, reduction in America. The reasons for decline in India is because Q4, in a general sense, is always the weakest quarter for India market. You know that traditionally, Q1 and Q2 are very strong for India. Q3 and Q4 are a little tepid in comparison. This time around America, so we -- a number of people raised this question to me in the morning, why have we reached less than $200 million because thats what you had guided for at the beginning of this year in America. But the fact is there has been price decline. This quarter, we were also stuck with, in fact, some one- times. So, in terms of losartan, we had our recall - were not able to sell and that actually -- the turnover and also the fact that there were returns associated with, in fact, the recall itself. So together -- and there was a price decline across a number of products because Brovana, we ran out of exclusivity status also. Levothyroxine and others, there were some -- there was a price reduction. So to that extent, you would also appreciate that the acute therapy range that we have in our portfolio, unfortunately, in the last two years to three years, we have not been able to make a whole lot because acute therapy has not been selling in America or in fact, in most parts of the globe. Then, of course, we talk about other therapy areas, including other SBUs, including API, who still have an issue in terms of acute therapy products, cephalosporins products. So, all of this has taken a toll and to that extent, Q4 has remained a little suppressed, so to speak. And if you look at the EBITDA margin, it has also come down. Theres close to INR127 crores impact only because of the fact that our sales were lower. But apart from that, there was, of course, the impact of several one-times. This is including the losartan recall and the costs associated May 19, 2022 with that. As you might also know, we lost our litigation for Solosec in terms of royalties we paid to the vendor and there were associated litigation costs and the like. So, all this actually took a toll. So, the one-time that actually comes into overall expenditure base. Apart from that, there was a swing from the last quarter because last quarter, there were settlement incomes, and those did not figure in this quarter. So actually, the swing is a little more marked in terms of -- its been a -- this big swing vis-à-vis in the previous quarter. The last was 13.7% on a normalized basis. This time, it came down because the sale as well as the one-times that we took, plus, of course. There were other developments, which are very noteworthy and important. We acquired Anglo-French. It was actually consummated in the first week of April, but important development, obviously. We also expanded -- we had a bolt-on acquisition in Australia, a very important one for us. We announced partnerships, strategic partnerships in China and then, of course, supply arrangements in China again and for other important products for Peg G-CSF and so on. You see the FDA approval for a number of products, 3 products as such. And of course, we had our inspection of our Tarapur facility last quarter. Next slide, please. Vinita, this is really your -- would you like to speak about America?",

      "content": "Sure. Sure. So, I think most of this is known. But if you look at our position in the U.S., certainly, we have a very strong market position with 44 products. We are market leaders. A very heartening development with albuterol. All of you know that we entered a little bit later than our competitors/ our peers in albuterol, but have now got 22.6%, almost 23% market share, so have ramped up very nicely. And when I look at Albuterol, Brovana, now inhalation products are over 25% of the companys -- the U.S. business revenue, a bigger part of the U.S. profitability. So, the transition into complex generics, certainly, in relation, its happening. We need to accelerate it, which we are looking forward to in fiscal year 23 as well as 24. We have material launches into the US. We have a good number of our portfolio. We are in 60 products in the market, 113 products. We are in top three in terms of market share. And a good number of products that are pending. So, from a pipeline perspective, when we compare it with all of our peers, we have one of the richest pipelines, both in terms of number of ANDAs that are pending as well as the complex products that we have above -- within the pipeline that gives us the headroom like Ramesh was saying, based on the conversation with some of you that our market cap pretty much reflects only the India business. We have tremendous upside here with the pipeline that we have built on the complex generics front for the US. On the revenue front, as Ramesh mentioned, we had softness in Q4, in particular, due to a couple of products, Albuterol, primarily phasing. We see Albuterol -- really again, the winter month is the volume is higher and then tapers down. So, we saw some of that, plus we had a regional competition in Brovana. So, we saw the impact of that. And we had the recall of losartan. Those were the three material reasons why revenues were down in May 19, 2022 Q4. And we launched a couple of products. We launched two products, small, though in the scheme of things. Our material products, we expect to really now in the next 12 months, the launch of Suprep into the U.S. And then later on in the fiscal year, we plan to launch Spiriva as well as FDA permitting Pegfilgrastim. So, weve had challenges this past year. Id say its been a year of really making the U.S. business stronger from a processes standpoint, from a balance sheet standpoint. We had a number of one-time impacts of gross to net items like FTS works that we cleaned up as well as returns, inventories for the flu season products like Oseltamivir and cephalosporin. So, we believe that we are in a strong position, but still need new product launches to grow the business. I mean, all of you have been close to the marketplace and the trends in the U.S. Our pricing pressure is still strong, especially on the oral solids. We continue to see double- digit pricing pressure. And so the only way to be able to grow both on revenues as well as profitability is a combination of new product launches and material new product launches, as well as continued cost reduction and optimization and both are a very strong focus for us.",

      "content": "Yes. Thank you. These are the other markets that we are present in. So, essentially, weve made some good progress across various markets. On the EU5, for example, we also -- Fostair was introduced, and we have been ramping up on NaMuscla as well. Australia, we made this acquisition, Southern Cross, which we believe would serve us good in the years to come. South Africa, now the fourth largest generics player, and of course, been a market leader in cardiovascular space for quite some time. Brazil -- so thats been a loss-making unit until very recently, but its turning around pretty nicely for us. Mexico, we are market leader in ophthalmology, number two actually, Sophia is number one. But in terms of values and then in developing a national footprint, we really are going the full hog out there. And of course, API business -- our fortunes have dipped this year essentially because of acute therapy products not selling in most parts. But I understand the JV business continues to do pretty well. Some headwinds in India on the TB front, but overall, still good growth. And as you might know, we are looking at getting kind of broad-basing our overall portfolio of products that we serve for the global institutional business. Next slide, please. The P&L, essentially, this is a snapshot. This was actually provided previously. We spoke about the fact that there has been a slight decline in overall sales. And we also spoke about the reason why there was a decline in overall EBITDA margins. And there are, of course, exceptional items from a write-off perspective also. This time around, we had accelerated amortization of certain intangibles in Gavis, which we took this year. And overall, given the fact that we actually had a huge exceptional items in Q3. We had -- we ended up with the entire year at an overall loss situation. But just to add, that the next two quarters could potentially be -- might have the same lackluster feeling. But the second half of next year onwards, you would actually see a step up in terms of sales, as well as in terms of the margins that go with it. As Vinita was saying, there are a number of products that we are looking at for America over the next several years. And for sure, I think this would begin in Q3 with Suprep and thats something which we already have an approval for. This is again a snapshot of what we spoke May 19, 2022 about. Essentially, the annualization of our annual results for the year, for the company. And I guess its something that we just spoke about in terms of the exceptional items, making this a very exceptional year in some ways. Next slide, please. Yes. R&D, as you can see, its been running steady at around INR350 crores, INR375 crores mark, so to speak, and now its around the 8% mark. But more importantly, the character of R&D is shifting. As Vinita was also saying, it is going to be more -- a lot more focus on complex generics, so its going to be inhalations and the injectables and biologics all the way -- biosimilars all the way. And of course, the salience of NCE would certainly come down over time. Theres been a tight rein on overall capital expenditure. As you can see, we used to -- it used to be in the INR1,800 crores range. Its hovering around the INR600 crores mark, but theres a lot of impetuses on reining in the CapEx cost expenditure outlays. And of course, from being a cash surplus company, there is a slight increase in overall debts. Theres tremendous scope for potentially working on working capital optimization. Its around 145 days currently, and we and my team are working on optimizing on that. It turned out to be a debt situationally because the fact that we had to pay up the settlements related to Glumetza, but that is one- time. Its a question of time if we kind of get back into the surplus situation until we actually start using it for productive purposes, including M&A. And thats something that we are saying, youll be looking at in India and worthwhile acquisitions in other parts also. Next slide, please. Really, your slide, Vinita. If you want to talk about complex generics, youre passionate about it.",

      "content": "So -- again, this is continuing on the same theme. We have already started monetizing our inhalation platform with products like albuterol that we have monetized in the US. Now a solid product for us. And some of these platforms, as you can see from the flags that we put in there are geographic. We have the potential of leveraging across multiple geographies. So, on the inhalation front, we also launched Fostair recently as said in U.K. and have plans to launch other inhalation products in U.K. and Europe as well, as well as China. So, the inhalation platform has started and in the next couple of years will really become a material part of our business, as well as geographical spread. I mean right now, we have albuterol, but looking at the next 12 months, Spiriva and then Dulera and Fostair. We have Qvar, the next wave of DPIs, MDIs, the Ellipta products, the Respimat products, all in the development on the inhalation front. On the biosimilars front, again, multiple geographies that we are addressing. And the focus has shifted from, of course, our first program, pegfilgrastim, for the US, which were looking forward to bringing to market soon, the products where we can be in the first phase, where we are in first or second to launch and have the potential of really getting major upside as well as a strong long-term position. On the injectables front, after inhalation and biosimilars in fiscal year 24, we will see material launches coming through. Weve had a number of complex filings. This past year, we have had our first peptide filing on the products like ganirelix, products like glucagon, our Risperdal Consta on the depot front, thats pretty far along. We hope to be the first company to file a 505(j) for Risperdal Consta and so on and so forth. So, material pipeline, complex product pipeline on the injectables front. On the womens health front, weve made significant progress on the drug device combinations. Products like Nexplanon and Mirena, weve already got proof-of-concept and have put these products into the clinic. Again, from a timing perspective, its inhalation now, biosimilars next, injectables soon thereafter and womens health in the 4-year to five-year time frame. Next slide, please.",

But needless to say, we have reserved rights of the product for the U.S. market. Pegfilgrastim, while we are a late entrant on Pegfilgrastim, really, for us, we will start learning the market through it. And hope that in the next 12 months, we get inspected by the FDA and well plan to launch the product. Were very pleased with our position actually on the on-body Onpro product, where we seem to be one of three and potentially in the first wave. Our customers are very, very keen to see us in the market with that product. So, we think we will really grow pegfilgrastim materially with the launch of Onpro, which is 10 months behind the pre-filled syringe but its going to be a material anchor for us on the biologics front. Lucentis is well under -- when we had some delays in the clinical trial with Covid, but now its well underway. And again, very strong partnership position in the U.S. that weve already established for Lucentis. Well share more as we come closer to the opportunity. And right after that is Eylea. So, on the ophthalmic front, both Lucentis and Eylea are going to be material opportunities for us that we would leverage through the channels that we have established relationships with. And then we have programs earlier stage in the pipeline that we are pursuing.",

Clearly, the size of the prize on the oral solids has come down, and the optimization is largely in line with that. But our key initiatives on the inhalation side, the injectable side, we are pursuing. Biosimilars, I think were still cherry picking. The idea is to have products that come in the first wave. Etanercept was different. But -- and I think we learned a lot through. But if you sort of look at the rest of the pipeline, that is intended to be first to market or one of two or three players in all. So, the optimization on the R&D, we feel good with this number. And I think were going to be able to stick with this kind of number for the foreseeable future. Or well possibly bring it down a tad even. But I think were seeing all the right opportunities that there are. May 19, 2022 Obviously, I think we have a wealth of portfolios and platforms to work with. But the filings that we have are huge as well. So 457 filings to-date. Theres still another 160 pending approval and a bunch of first to files as well. A lot of that in -- close to end of this fiscal and in FY 24 onwards, youll start seeing those coming to market. I cant see the bottom. I think Ive touched on most of that already. So Ramesh? Yes.

And obviously, the FDA is now ramping up inspections within the country. And were going to get mixed outcomes basis, basis that -- basis of the readiness of the individual company. May 19, 2022 I would say for Lupin, just because of the geographical location, I would say that the India plants are operating under one leadership structure and one set of principles. The overall SOPs and are all the same, but I think local implementation, there might be some nuances, which will be there. We had some leadership gaps in Somerset, both in manufacturing and quality. And I think both of those led and both of those positions have been replaced and filled back. We are not happy with what came out of Somerset, but I think Tarapur is representative. So, I think, obviously, we had certain observations. We were able to address them to satisfaction with the FDA. And we would certainly hope that Tarapur goes the same way. Weve sent in our response, end of this month. Next week, well send in an update as well, basis which we should see the outcome of that inspection. And then thats what I would expect for the other inspections as well. Were very clear that we have to get across this compliance rut that weve had. Its been going on for 5 years. And I think what we have set up is pretty solid at the OpEx level from a governance perspective, bringing in people like Diana in the US. I think that is a great opportunity for our people to learn to be -- to become best-in-class as well. So were committed. I think we -- its there in the comment. Its an aspiration. Were certainly not best-in-class at this point in time, but we know that we need to be best-in-class to be a strong generic company. And for the India plants, I think were there. We have inspections, obviously, which will come up for Pithampur unit 2, and for Mandideep. These should go the same way as well. And Somerset, I think theres a very clear plan on remediation as well. Again, we had a set of observations. We had a set of observations. Again, our track record does not speak well for Somerset. But the team is extremely motivated to fix it, and this is kind of their opportunity now. They need to fix this now. And weve given them the tools. We have the people, certainly whatever resources that they need as well. We should come out of these now.",

Less than 5% of our revenues come from FDA impacted sites, first of all, of our U.S. generic revenue. Pithampur 2 and Goa were the two big sites where there were a bunch of products stuck in Goa. Youve seen some of these approvals coming. Well do at least seven launches out of Goa this year, and theres another 15, 20 that will come over time as well. May 19, 2022 Pithampur is even more. I think theres about 30-odd products, which are stuck with these FDA compliance. Some of them wont launch anymore because the time value of those opportunities is gone. But theres still some extended release products that I like. I think those are all really good opportunities to launch. So that will come out of Pithampur as well. None of these are big swingers. I think the big swingers come out from inhalation, from injectables, from biosimilars as well, some first-to-files as well. Those first-to-files are from -- some of them were from Pithampur. We transferred some of them. Theyre mostly from Nagpur and Goa, and those are protected.",

Our biggest unleash for the organization is our pipeline delivery and platform performance, for which we identify the need of a very strong Chief Scientific Officer. So, we have a search ongoing for it. We have an Interim Head of R&D, Interim CSO, our Head of Portfolio and Pipeline. Sofia Mumtaz is our Interim Chief Scientific Officer. And weve also created a very high-powered -- not high powered, in terms of level in terms of leadership, but a very strong project management office that reports into Nilesh and myself to map and to track all products from product selection to development, to filing and launch to ensure that we get the most out of our R&D investment.

Within three months, we went from 13 observations to clearance of the warning letter. So, actually it gives rise to new opportunities for us. We had couple of products stuck that we were tech transferring into other sites and we expect these products to get approved in the near term. So apart from Suprep, we think that couple of the other niche products like we have diazepam gel, that is small but nice niche product that we likely can get approval for in the next six months. Likewise, we have a nasal spray where we are first to file Nascobal. It doesnt help us this fiscal year, but its June next fiscal year. And we have exclusive first to file on that one, so we will likely get approval for that one as well. So, we have positive momentum there on new product launches that we can really do with to help grow our business. While we have Tiotropium, we also want additional products that can help us grow the business.",

External, certainly from a market perspective, internal from the standpoint of delivery, certainly with the GMP challenges that we had that hampered the ability to really get the right number of products into the market that really help offset a lot of the external challenges. We have done a number of things to try to address these challenges, as Nilesh spoke. I mean, we have clear focus on the GMP front, have really taken it to a different level to ensure that all of our sites are meet and exceed FTS expectations out of the five sites that were in trouble, we have cleared two and are confident of clearing the other three as well while keeping the rest of the sites compliant and thats crucial. Thats the backbone of the business to help us deliver every product that we file from a R&D perspective. So, really getting the new product launch engine fixed is a big part of our focus. Its a combination of people as well as processes that we have booked upon and we are fairly confident with the changes that we have made, aided by the GMP status changing. Now, we should be able to really kick start the new product engine effectively from this year onward. So, I mean, for a generic drug company, I mean, its crucial to get new products. Good number of meaningful new products to launch. So, thats just one of them. I mean, there are many areas where we talked about issues with FTS, back orders that plagued quarters in the last fiscal year. We have done a number of things to streamline our supply chain. We have implemented integrated business planning in the company last year. That has changed the visibility that our team has end to end, the alignment our team has to ensure that we maximize on the products that we have in the market. We minimize, mitigate any failure to supply penalties and back orders. And we are in a much, much different place today than we were 12 months ago. I mean, the numbers dont show that as of yet, but we are confident that you will see it in the quarters to come.",

      "content": "Hi, everyone. This is Vinita Gupta here. A very warm welcome to our Q2 earnings call. I have with me our Managing Director, Nilesh, as well as our CFO, Ramesh and members of our Finance and Investor Relations teams. Trust you all have seen our numbers for the quarter, and Ramesh will share a deeper analysis of our performance. As you would have noted, our business has improved. Revenue growth was driven by the bounce back of our U.S. business along with continued growth in our India business, and also growth across all other geographies. On the margin front, we see the benefit of our optimization measures in addition to the revenue growth in the business. We are focused on sustaining this positive momentum for the rest of the year. I would like to share some of the business highlights with you. On the U.S. front, we have continued to evolve our business with optimization of oral solids, driving growth of complex generics, respiratory franchise, in particular and executing on our new product launches. During the quarter, our respiratory franchise contribution increased, and we executed on a couple of new product launches in particular Suprep that will help growth in Q3 and Q4. It had some contribution in Q2, but since it was launched in September, more to come in Q3 and Q4. In addition, we closed our acquisition of the Sunovion brands, Brovana and Xopenex that will enable us to enhance our respiratory position in the U.S., while contributing to revenue as well as profitability growth. As we look at the quarters ahead, we have new product launches like Spiriva, Diazepam Gel, Nascobal Nasal Spray and Darunavir, multiple products where we have exclusivity or first-to-market position that will enable us to grow our U.S. business in a profitable manner. On Spiriva, while we had hoped to get an approval by now, we are close. We have responded to all the queries the agency had raised and are working closely with the FDA to get approval by our eligible launch date. We will know more in the next few weeks, and well share what we learn with all of you. In any case, we see this as a substantial contributor for fiscal year 24 and will definitely have a significant runway based on the competitive position at present. November 10, 2022 Switching to India, the largest part of our business, while our growth in the quarter and the first half has been below market, this is primarily due to the loss of Cidmus from our cardiovascular portfolio and generalisation in the gliptins. But for the diabetes portfolio, our India business grew ahead of the market. Also, the diabetes franchise, while impacted in the near term, we expect growth in the mid- to long term given the continued growth in diagnosis and increased affordability with generics coming to the market, and our own generics. In our top therapy areas, respiratory and cardiac growth was in line with the market and therapeutic areas that we are trying to build like GI and womens health were well above the market. We expect the second half of the year to be better than H1 from a growth perspective and are committed to get our India business back to double-digit growth in the quarters and years to come. All other markets continued to grow and perform as per expectations, in particular, we saw a really strong local currency growth in Mexico and strong double-digit growth across Australia, Germany, Canada and U.K., our other developed markets. On the margin front, we have seen significant efforts that we have had underway in the last 12 to 18 months’ payoff, our margins did improve, and we expect to see this benefit continue in the quarters to come despite inflationary pressures. A word on the compliance front, we have made progress this past year with the clearance of Goa and Somerset warning letters and successful inspection of Ankleshwar and Nagpur. However, the warning letter at Tarapur certainly was disappointing for us. We have clarified with the agency that it is only specific products that we have discontinued over the last couple of years from the site and we continue to manufacture a number of key products with a clear commitment to meet the FDAs concerns on nitrosamine and cross-contamination that they highlighted to us during the inspection and in the warning letter. Overall, we are moving in the right direction, as you can see from what we have delivered in the quarter and are really committed to grow both revenues and profitability in the quarters to come, while executing on our strategic plan. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

We also have a few MDI products that we are pursuing. And you will see those also will be filed in the next couple of years.

      "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, friends. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q3 earnings call. I have with me our Managing Director, Nilesh as well as our CFO, Ramesh. As you would have noted, we have continued to build on our momentum in Q3, both on revenues and in particular, on margins. Im very pleased that in Q3, our US business performed well, India business growth improved, and API business rebounded as well. On the margin front, we saw the benefit of NPLs in the US, seasonal product upside as well, and continued savings from our optimization measures. We are focused on sustaining this positive momentum, in particular as material new product launches start and our recent investment in our sales force expansion in India starts yielding results. I will let Ramesh talk through the performance in deeper detail. I would like to share some of the business highlights. In the US, we have continued to evolve our business with optimization of oral solids, driving growth of complex generics, respiratory franchise in particular, and executing on our new product launches. During the quarter, our in-line business was almost flat with slight decline due to exit from low-margin products, offset almost completely by seasonal products. New product launches in the year contributed well in the quarter, with Suprep ramping up, Perforomist generic successful launch and then Pennsaid authorized generic launch. Our respiratory franchise strengthened with albuterol continued strong performance, addition of Brovana and Xopenex brands as well as generics launch. As we look at the quarters ahead, we expect new product launches like gSpiriva, gDiazepam Gel, gNascobal Nasal Spray and gDarunavir, all products where we have either exclusivity or first to market position, which will drive growth of our US business in a profitable manner. On Spiriva, we continue to make progress and have received priority review from the FDA for a target action date in April, without inspection, or July, with inspection. In the meantime, we are getting ready with launch preparedness. We continue to see Tiotropium as a substantial opportunity for fiscal year 24 with a significant runway, given the competitive dynamics. Products like gDiazepam Gel and gNascobal, we now hope to see approval soon given the recent successful Somerset audit. Our US generics business has come a long way in calendar year 22, still a long way to go. However, with the February 10, 2023 new product launches coming in, continued optimization efforts, focused efforts on building a niche inhalation, as well as injectables pipeline, we are optimistic that we will grow our US business in the next couple of years. Switching to India, the largest part of our business, while our growth in the quarter and first half has been below market, this is primarily due to loss of Cidmus from a cardiovascular portfolio and genericization in the diabetes segment in the gliptins. But for the diabetes portfolio, our growth in Q3 was in line with market, with therapeutic areas like cardiac, GI, respiratory, all delivering double-digit growth. Our gynaecology and GI have actually been the fastest growth therapeutic areas for us. This quarter, we have added close to a 1,000 reps, created six new divisions to expand our reach and share of wallets. We expect the investments to get us to above market growth in the quarters ahead. We are committed to growing our India business to double- digit growth in the quarters ahead. Other than India and the US, our API business recovered with the growth in cephalosporins and other countries like UK on the back of Fostair generic and Germany due to NaMuscula grew as well quarter-over-quarter. On the margin front, we expect continued improvement in particular as we execute on new product launches and our recent investment in the sales force in India starts yielding results. Likewise, we continue to focus on cost optimization efforts. While we have been successful in optimizing our manpower costs, we have been very disciplined in getting out of low margin products that has not allowed us to optimize our idle costs. Nevertheless, we are confident with the efforts that we have underway, we should be able to move the needle on this front in the quarters to come as well. On the compliance front, we have made progress with positive outcomes on sites like Ankleshwar, Nagpur injectables and Somerset. Weve also made substantial progress on our remediation efforts in Tarapur and Mandideep. The recent approval of our injectables facility will enable us to start building our organic injectables portfolio in full earnest. Overall, we are moving in the right direction. We expect the pace to get better, as we execute on our material new product launches in the quarters ahead. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for deeper analysis of our performance.",

And from an industry perspective, weve obviously had a few examples where quality is somewhat pretty bad in other markets and the like. And unfortunately, I think that brings the industry in a bad light. We are coming out from -- we had I believe about 60 odd inspections in India in 2022 versus the normal 200 plus. So obviously were getting into a period where there will be more FDA inspections and with the number of facilities that we have, as an industry, there will be obviously some portion of negative outcome that will come out as well. But I think - I would only -- we had five observations in Nagpur. Everybody gave us a hard time. Weve got the approval thereafter, right.

Even with the follow-on inspection, Mandideep clearly, we were not at the right level. Were taking the right steps to not blow out further than what it is. But its not acceptable. Tarapur is not acceptable as well. And there is a clear remediation plan on this. So, we do believe that we will get them to the right spot. Were not just going to leave them there just because the contribution maybe below a certain level. Whatever we supply, every product that we supply has to be of the right quality. People dont have to look at where the product was made. So, we are committed to this. I think the industry is committed to it in a broader sense as well. Certainly, it is scrutiny on industry is going to be there. And we have to be up to snuff.",

      "content": "Hi Everyone. This is Vinita here. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q4 FY23 earnings call. I have with me our MD, Nilesh, as well as our CFO, Ramesh. Were very pleased to close the fiscal year with continued improvement in operating margins. Our team has had a sharp focus on getting our India business back to double digit growth and quarter after quarter improvement in US margins as well this focus along with growth in other areas like API, EMEA and APAC enabled us to deliver margin improvement as planned. We are committed to sustaining this positive momentum into the new fiscal year and driving strong growth across all our regions in particular: India, based on our recent salesforce expansion; and the US aided by material new product launches. Our India business as you would have noted recorded an 11% plus growth per IQVIA, ex the diabetes portfolio growth was 15% plus, in line with the market growth. In Q4, we made a significant investment to expand our sales force in India and enhance our reach. Were very pleased that overall we delivered margin improvement for the organization despite this material investment. In the US we improved our margins for a third quarter in a row through portfolio optimization, maximizing the high value products and continued cost optimization efforts. We were able to improve our margins despite increase in R&D spends quarter over quarter. Overall, when you look at it for the year, the R&D spend for the US was $100 million with an increasing proportion of complex generics in particular inhalation and injectables. Apart from India getting to double digit growth and U.S. business improvement, our API business recovered in the quarter with demand growth in our core products. Our EMEA business grew driven by South Africa quarter over quarter and Fostair (Luforbec) in Europe year over year. In APAC, our Philippines subsidiary performed very well. Switching to R&D, we continue to drive the shift to complex genetics with a focus on respiratory and injectable products. We filed 19 products in the US and 10 ex-US. Of the US filings, we had four injectables, 3 nasal sprays and we made progress on Respimat and Ellipta products on both platforms. Apart from generics, on the R&D front, we optimized the New Chemical Entity (NCE) R&D spent in Q3 to focus on only two of our oncology pipeline programs, significantly reducing the discovery spend. Switching to compliance, weve made progress in part with positive outcomes on the Ankleshwar, Vizag, Nagpur injectables and Somerset sites. Weve also May 10, 2023 made substantial progress on our remediation efforts in Tarapur, Mandideep Unit 1 and Pithampur Unit 2. We are committed to ensure that we get all our sites to a consistent and sustainable level of compliance. Im sure well see more progress on this front in fiscal year 2024. On the M&A front, our recent acquisitions have performed well with Anglo French; Southern Cross; Xopenex, Brovana in the US and Paloma in Brazil, all delivering as per plan. Our recent acquisition of Medisol in France enables us to accelerate our injectables franchise in Europe. We are very pleased to be able to close that. We have come a long way in fiscal year 2023 and I am excited about the prospects in fiscal year 24 as we launch products like Tiotropium, Darunavir and others in the US and drive consistent double-digit growth in our India business. We remain focused on driving operating margin improvement as we grow our business. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

The information request that were May 10, 2023 getting beyond the last CRL that we responded to was really clarification on the testing method, sample size and the like, the rationale for it and what is giving us comfort is the fact that they started clearing parts of the application. We weve been already informed that the pD-pK was cleared a while ago and the fact that the DMF has been cleared last week and we continue to get minor queries at this point gives us the comfort that were pretty close.",

Were close to remediation of Mandideep as well. Pithampur, were hoping with the next update we close out all the observations that we had and the next step obviously would be to engage with FDA and get feedback.

We look forward to sharing our Q1 highlights and outlook for the fiscal year. We are very pleased to start the new fiscal year strong with continued momentum across our major regions, improving compliance position, multiple new product approvals and improvement in operating margins. Our India business is firmly back to double digit growth and the US business margin has continued to improve. We expect to see material improvement in the rest of this fiscal year as we launch Tiotropium and other new products in the US as well as our sales force expansion in India starts yielding expected productivity from Q2 onwards. Our India business recorded an 11.5% growth QoQ and 10.2% growth YOY and this is after the NLEM impact as well as CIDMUS brand that we had in the base last year. Cardiology and Respiratory TA’s grew better than market growth, our Diabetes TA that has been a challenge for the last many quarters due to loss of exclusivity of key in-licensed brands is now back to growth as planned by our team. As we look at Q2 and beyond, based on the momentum we have and the enhanced productivity from the sales force expansion, we now feel confident of consistent above market growth. Switching to the US, our margins continued to improve for the fourth quarter in a row on the strength of a stable base business, continued performance of key products like Albuterol, Lisinopril and Suprep, launch of Darunavir where we had exclusivity on the 800 mg strength. In addition to revenue growth and better product mix and therefore better gross margins, we also continued to deliver on reducing SG&A as well as distribution cost. With the approvals of products like Tiotropium, Cyanocobalamin, Diazepam gel and other approvals now likely due to Pithampur Unit 2 Warning Letter clearance, we have a rich August 4, 2023 pipeline of products to drive revenue and margin growth in the US for the rest of this fiscal year and beyond. Apart from India and the US, all other regions performed well too in particular our Institutional TB and API business did extremely well during the quarter. On the R&D front, our spend increased QoQ, driven by patent litigation on key products, Ranibizumab clinical trial and long-acting Risperidone completion. On the NCE front, we were very pleased to receive the milestone from Abbvie for our program advancing into the clinic. Our pipeline is now positioned well to evolve our business into complex generics with inhalation MDI and DPI, injectables from Nagpur and partnered products, as well as complex ophthalmic products from Pithampur Unit-2. On the compliance front we have made progress with positive outcomes with Pithampur Unit-2 warning letter clearance that will enable us to launch Ophthalmic products filed from the site in particular products like Prolensa where we were first to file as well as other ophthalmic products next year. that will enable us to launch important products like PROLENSA, where we are first to file, as well as other ophthalmic products next year. Out of the five sites we had under warning letter, we have now cleared three and continue to make progress on our remediation efforts in Tarapur and Mandideep. We are committed to ensure that we will get all our sites to a consistent and sustainable level of compliance. We are excited to start fiscal year 24 on a strong note and look forward to executing on our new product launches, continued momentum in India, and operating margin improvement as we grow our business in the year. We expect fiscal year 24 to be strong with quarter-after-quarter improvement in revenues and profitability. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

So it is certainly going to be elevated, but you would also appreciate weve been talking about, in fact, a higher quantum of investments on the sales and promotion front, especially in India, and weve added about 1,300 people in Q3, Q4 of last year. So obviously, this will also be reflected in higher expenditure, on account of that, it will then commensurate increase in terms of the sales itself. This particular quarter there has been increase in nitrosamine expense on account of nitrosamine quality assurance and the like, on account of compliance, and of course, there is an R&D spend, which is on the higher side. We expect the R&D to kind of sustain at these levels. Of course, there has been a provisioning for non-product-related litigation. Thats kind of one time. So, the parts of this, which will certainly continue into the future. But what we actually had guided for is successive increase on the EBITDA front. And thats what we would be concerned about. And you will certainly see this in quarter two, three, and four.",

And we continue to work with the FDA, to try to get clarity on our inspection outcome at our Pune site for pegfilgrastim. So, we hope to be able to get clarity on that soon. The R&D, that I had spoken about was the clinical trials spend on ranibizumab that we had incremental spend this quarter versus the previous. And we continue to pursue ranibizumab in particular for the U.S. as well as through partners into other markets as well. So thats on, as far as the biosimilars go. On the injectables front, we are actively adding to our pipeline right now with both 505 (j) as well as 505 (b) (2) opportunities. With the Nagpur approval -- FDA inspection and approval, we now expect to get multiple product approvals out of the site for the U.S. August 4, 2023 Certainly later in this fiscal year, we hope to be able to get products like Glucagon onto the market. In this last quarter, we launched Thiamine, which was out of our partnership with Caplin Point. And so we have a combination of both internal products as well as partner products that we expect to help build the injectables business, starting this year, but more so also into the next fiscal year and beyond. We have within our pipeline a large percentage of the products that we are pursuing now are injectables.",

And we see price erosion really at a low-single digit percentage at this point on inline products, on our base portfolio.

We got out of a number of products that we had announced last year, that didnt make sense. They were not economically viable anymore. Likewise, a number of our peers got out of products. And I think that has led to drug shortages. Right now, drug shortages is a huge concern that weve heard from folks on the hill, in the U.S., as well as from the FDA, as well as other stakeholders. So, I think the fact that it had become such a tough environment for the generic industry finally has struck home and has led to this price stabilization, which we hope will continue going forward.

I have with me our MD Nilesh, our CFO Ramesh and our head of Investor Relations Ravi. We look forward to sharing our Q2 highlights and outlook for the Fiscal year. We are very pleased to build on the momentum over the last couple of quarters and deliver significant improvement in operating margins driven by growth across majority of our regions, US launch of Tiotropium and continued focus on efficiencies. Our US business delivered continued growth in revenues and margins for a 5th quarter in a row on the strength of a stable base business, launch of Tiotropium and overall strong performance on respiratory products. In the quarter, respiratory products contributed 45%+ of our revenues. We expect to sustain our business at $200mn plus level now going forward with the continued ramp up of Tiotropium and other NPLs in H2 and beyond. Our India business recorded growth inline with the market, with better than market performance in key therapeutic areas Cardiology, Respiratory, GI and Women’s health that we are building. Diabetes TA which was in a de-growth mode is back to growth, and will continue to build on it in the quarters to come. As we look at the second half, we expect that the investments we made in expanding on sales force to get to a level of productivity that will help us build on our growth rate from the first half. We already started seeing gains in the start of Q3, October has been strong and we expect to continue that in the rest of Q3 and Q4 for our India business. Apart from US and India, other regions performed well too. In particular Europe recorded strong growth due to ramp up of generic gFostair in our direct markets like UK and Germany as well as through partners in other parts of EU. November 9, 2023 On the R&D and pipeline front we have continued to build on the momentum with both material FTF and complex generics. We were very pleased to get key product approvals like generic gTolvaptan and generic gXywav in October that will drive big part of growth in next couple of years, in particular gTolvaptan. Our pipeline is now positioned well to evolve our business into complex generics with Inhalation, Injectables and complex Ophthalmic products given the Pithampur Unit 2 clearance. On the compliance front we have continued to make progress and are committed to ensure that we get all our sites to a consistent and sustainable level of compliance. With the strong focus on delivering the pipeline coupled with compliance gains, we can now see a clear path to sustainable growth over the next few years for our business. We are delighted to deliver strong performance in the first half of this fiscal year and look forward to executing on our New Product Launches, continued momentum in India & other markets with a strong focus on sustaining and improving our operating margins in the second half. With this I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "$5 million, okay. Yes, sure. And my last question is your presentation mentioned you are building up quite well on the complex project side, 40 plus injectables and then 20 plus inhalers et cetera. In next say two to three years, how many filings we can see on the complex opportunity side? Inhalers, injectables et cetera, and if you can also call out some near-term key filings which you are expecting. Vinita D. Gupta: Sure, so majority of our R&D focus has been on the complex generics, in particular inhalation and injectables, ophthalmics as well as first to files, exclusive first-to-files in particular. And we have got a good pipeline in place right now to drive the business growth towards complex generics. Already a good part of it in the U.S. is now respiratory. But as I look at the next two years with the pipeline that we have in place, on the ophthalmic front, given the Pithampur Unit 2 clearance, multiple ophthalmics, five or six products that we expect to bring to market in the second half of this fiscal year as well as into the next fiscal year. We have products like Bromday, Bromsite, Loteprednol, Prolensa, all that were expecting approval for and then launch over the next couple of years. November 9, 2023 On the injectable front, we have a good pipeline now in place, multiple products in development, a few products that we expect to launch in the current fiscal year. We think Ganirelix, Famotidine will launch this fiscal year and then next fiscal year we hope to launch Glucagon. That would be a material one for us and then depending on litigation outcome also, Liraglutide in fiscal year 26. And then lastly, I would say on the injectable front, Risperdal Consta, a long-acting Risperidone out of Nanomi should come to market by fiscal year 26. So, both opthalimics and injectables ramp-up in the second half of this year, but more so in fiscal year 25. And then, also the first-to-file oral solids like Tolvaptan in fiscal year 26. Were very pleased to get that approval in October, our goal date, As well as, products like Mirabegron and Oracea and Doxycycline. we expect both approvals as well as litigation outcome over the next couple of months that will enable us to confirm launch dates, but we expect to launch in the next, two years.",

So, we are constantly tracking, and plan even with a direct-to-market salesforce effort to really have a very targeted niche salesforce that can double-up with our injectable business, so we can have some operating leverage as opposed to having a single product investment. So, watching that carefully, and we also have, apart from our own plans and potential to launch, we also have interest from partners.

We look forward to sharing our Q3 highlights and outlook for the fiscal year. Were very pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong performance. Continuing to build on the momentum over the last many quarters, we delivered our highest quarterly sales so far, crossing the INR 5,000 crore mark. What is very heartening is that all our major regions have performed. Not only have we seen revenues grow across our key segments, but we also achieved higher profitability both at the gross and operating level. Our US business delivered a second consecutive quarter of $200 plus mn revenues and a sixth straight quarter of EBITDA improvement, which was very heartening. This has been aided by volume-led growth in our base business, augmented by contribution from seasonal products and our Respiratory portfolio including Tiotropium. As mentioned in our earlier interaction, we expect to sustain our US business at the $200 plus mn levels in the next few quarters as we get into the next year with a continued ramp- up of Tiotropium and launch of new products, including multiple ophthalmic and complex injectable range. Our India business recorded strong double-digit growth this quarter with 1.6 times IPM growth rate. Most of our therapeutic areas like Respiratory, GI, Gynaecology have outperformed IPM during the quarter. We have launched around 21 products in the year so far and per IQVIA, we are ranked number one in new product launches in India. We have a strong chronic focus as you know, with more than 60% of our sales contribution from chronic therapies. We believe that we are in a very good position now to deliver above-market growth consistently going ahead led by higher productivity from our sales force expansion, new divisions, and enhanced penetration and reach. February 8, 2023 Apart from the US and India, other regions have performed very well too. Ex- US and India, our Formulations business has grown 30% YoY during the quarter and 22% in the nine months during the fiscal led by strong growth recorded in key markets like Canada, Philippines, Australia, and South Africa and also a very strong ramp-up of generic Fostair in our direct markets UK, Germany as well as through partners in the Rest of Europe. Switching to R&D. On the pipeline front, we have continued to build momentum with both material First-to-Files and complex generics. We received 14 ANDA approvals during this quarter, including key product approvals like generic Tolvaptan and Ganirelix, which is our first peptide injectable product. We also launched Bromfenac Ophthalmic Solution, the generic version of Prolensa, thanks to our Pithampur Unit 2 facility approval. And as you know, we have six-month exclusivity on this product. Out of Somerset, we launched Diazepam Rectal Gel, which has also been an extremely nice launch for us. In terms of key filings, in the last quarter, we filed Risperdal Consta product out of Nanomi, which is a significant validation of the platform as well as strong complex injectable product filings for us. So as I mentioned before, our R&D is evolving to more complex products, especially on the inhalation and complex injectables front, which augurs well for the sustainable growth of our business going ahead. Compliance is our number one priority and we are fully committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world that we serve. We have completed remediation efforts at Tarapur and Mandideep Unit 1 and are confident that we will get these sites cleared as we have done with the others in the near future. We are delighted to have delivered on our promise of sustained and profitable growth during this year. We feel confident that our strategic focus on R&D, patient centricity on the brand front, and continued cost business optimization sets us on a path of sustainable growth going forward. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance. February 8, 2023",

And if you just look at what it took for us to get approval of the product, it was five years at the FDA, and that was because the product is a pretty challenging product. So we feel pretty good about the next couple of years, hopefully building Spiriva to a very good level. On Dulera, I mean, weve had an extremely good meeting with the agency back in the November, and that gives us confidence that the response that we are putting together is going to meet the agencys requirements.

      "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, friends. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q4, and end of FY24 earnings call. I have with me our MD, Nilesh; our CFO, Ramesh; and our Head of Investor Relations, Ravi. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as the full-year and outlook for fiscal year 25. We are very pleased to close the year on a strong note, continuing to improve our operating margins and maintain the business momentum for the last many quarters. Revenues in the quarter have grown 13% year-over-year driven by all major regions, in particular, U.S., India, EMEA and APAC. Gross margins and operating margins improved in Q4, based on better business and product mix, in particular in the U.S. and also higher efficiencies. We were very pleased that EBITDA margins improved quarter over quarter, despite higher R&D investments and Q4 seasonality impact in U.S. and India. Our U.S. business continues strong at $200 million plus revenues, despite lower seasonal products and reduction in products like Darunavir that experienced additional competition. Our base business performed well, and new products like Tiotropium and generic Prolensa helped offset the seasonal product decline. We are at a good level with 30% substitution with Tiotropium, 10 months into the launch. We expect Tiotropium to continue to be a major growth driver in fiscal year 25. We had 6 product launches in the US during the quarter with Prolensa Ophthalmic, Ganirelix Inj and Cyanocobalamin being the meaningful ones. February 8, 2023 We expect to sustain our U.S. business at the $200 million plus level, going ahead with the continued ramp-up of Tiotropium and new product launches in fiscal year 25. We have 10 plus launches during the year. Our India business has grown 8.3% year-over-year in the quarter, and 9.6% for fiscal year 24. Within this, our India prescription business has grown 8.7% year-over-year and ex-Cidmus 9.3% year-over-year on full year basis, this was 1.2 times IPM growth. Core therapies like cardio and respiratory segments have grown well ahead of the market and we are very confident of continued 25-30% over IPM in fiscal year FY’25. We have already started to see this in April. We have also carved out our trade-generics business into a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary to enhance agility and drive focus on this high- growth segment. Apart from the U.S. and India, other regions have performed well too. EMEA and APAC recorded strong double-digit growth in the quarter, driven by Fostair generic in Europe and strong growth in markets like Australia as well as Philippines. We complemented our global respiratory portfolio by acquiring two accretive established brands from Sanofi for Europe and Canada. During the year, we also closed our Medisol transaction, the French complex injectable company, which expands our position in complex generics, in particular in Europe. On the R&D front, we have continued to pivot to more complex products, in particular inhalation and complex injectables. We spend around 50% of our R&D investments in these two platforms. Complex products today constitute around 40% of our US portfolio which we expect to increase to about 50% to 60% in the next few years. In the fiscal year 2024, more than 80% of our new product revenues in the U.S. were from non-oral solid products. This augurs well for sustainable growth of our generic business going forward. Switching to compliance, we have continued to build on our momentum with recent inspections at Aurangabad and Dabhasa with positive outcomes. We February 8, 2023 are on track with our remediation efforts at our Tarapur and Mandideep Unit 1 sites and are fully committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with best-in-class GMP standards. Reflecting on the year gone by, fiscal year 2024 has truly been an inflection point for our organization. We are very pleased to turn around our business and deliver on our promise of sustained and profitable growth, driving the shift to complex generics, getting our India business growth to 20% to 30% above market, improving our GMP compliance position and continuing to drive efficiencies. It has also been a year of growth across all our regions and business segments. As we look at FY’25 and beyond we are focused on continuing to drive margin improvement while growing and evolving our business, building on our portfolio evolution into complex generics and specialty. We are truly excited with the potential we have ahead of us. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "We certainly have seen things stabilizing. When we looked at number of the drug shortages and analysed the root cause, the largest percentage was, they were economically non-viable. So companies like us, a number of our peers had gotten out of these products, because they were just, from a pricing standpoint, had come down to a level where it didn’t make sense to continue to manufacture them. So there’s been a good amount of recognition of it, both with our customers as well as the other stakeholders, the U.S. government, the FDA, the FTC, there’s been a good level of concern across the board in the U.S. on these drug shortages and the cause for drug shortages. And, we think that’s the reason that price erosion has stabilized to some level. And, we’re going to hopefully continue to see this going forward. Structurally, I’d say that there are a lot of stakeholders in Washington D.C., that are looking hard at the reasons for these drug shortages and are working hard to see what they can do to prevent these. So, there is a good amount of scrutiny on the market dynamics that are causing companies to exit products. And hopefully, that will bring some level of balance in the marketplace or continue to maintain the balance in the marketplace, which will be promising for the U.S. generic market. On biosimilars, our focus so far has been on development and manufacturing of the products that we have chosen to get into. We have Enbrel, of course, Etanercept that we have partnered with Mylan, which is now with Biocon. We have other partners like Sandoz in Canada, and we have the right to the February 8, 2023 U.S. ourselves, which comes available in 2029. So that is kind of a partner product so far. We have Pegfilgrastim that were still waiting to get FDA approval. In fact, we just resubmitted our supplement, the CRL response. We are actually in the process of resubmitting it shortly, but believe that we are in a very good position there as well to get FDA approval. So far, weve got European, Japanese, every other regulatory authority, but not the U.S. FDA approval. Thats going to be an important one for us in fiscal year 25. And then we have other products that we have pretty far along, like Lucentis- Ranibizumab. We intend to file in fiscal year 25 to the FDA and as well as other parts of the world. So that should be a good opportunity for us on the ophthalmic front. And then we have a couple of respiratory products that were pursuing as well, Mepolizumab and Benralizumab, and tracking the markets very closely to see if we can try to get the products through some of the countries without a PD study. So, we continue to build on our biosimilar platform and strategy, but cautiously, I would say, because there are tremendous amount of hurdles as well on the biosimilars front that we have seen both from a regulatory perspective in terms of what it takes to get it through FDA and other agencies, as well as market access from a go-to-market standpoint, and then at the end of the day, the contracting strategy of the brand. So cautiously building that portfolio, which will serve us long-term as a really nice additional platform that will help us differentiate our portfolio.",

      "content": "Good afternoon, friends. Im very pleased to welcome you to our Q1 fiscal year 25 earnings call. I have with me our MD - Nilesh and our CFO - Ramesh. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as outlook for the year ahead. We are very pleased to start the new fiscal year on a strong note with solid double digit growth in revenues and margins both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis. EBITDA margins at 23.3% have expanded by 290 basis points quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong commercial execution on new product launches as well as in line products, continuous attention to operational improvements as well as lower than anticipated R&D spend. In parallel, we have continued to improve our position on the quality and compliance front, having received positive FDA inspection outcomes for our Aurangabad, Somerset, Nagpur and Dabhasa facilities in the last quarter. Our US business had a great start with strong growth sequentially and year- over-year driven by more stable in-line business, strong contribution from respiratory products both Tiotropium as well as Albuterol and new product launches like Mirabegron and Doxycycline that more than offset decline in products like Suprep® that have seen additional competition. As we look at the quarters ahead, with continued ramp up of the new products that we have launched, additional new product launches like Pred- Forte® that we just received with CGT, Glucagon later in the fiscal year, Liposomal Doxorubicin that were in the midst of launching at present, we expect to grow our US business at a high single-digit in fiscal year 25. Also, August 7, 2024 our US business has returned to a strong level of margins given the shift to complex generics and strong focus on driving productivity and efficiencies in the base business. Switching to India, we recorded 10.5% growth versus IPM growth of 8.7%, which was 21% ahead of the market. Cardiac, Respiratory, GI and Vitamins business in India grew well ahead of market. Our internal diabetes portfolio, non-licensed diabetes portfolio that is, grew at 2 times the category growth during the quarter, which was very heartening for us. We also successfully completed the carve out of our trade generics business in India to 100% own subsidiary with the objective of achieving agility, better focus and growth of this business going ahead. From a new product launch perspective, we have been at the forefront in terms of NPLs in India and have a healthy pipeline of around 20 products which we plan to launch in the fiscal year. We are confident that our reach through our 10,000 plus reps along with our portfolio enhancements will enable us to grow around 20% to 30% higher than the market in the year ahead as we have guided in our earlier interactions. Switching to other markets, our other developed markets grew a strong double-digit, driven by Canada due to Zaxine® - our brand business there, and new product launches like Spiriva® and Etanercept, UK due to Luforbec® and new product launches in Germany and Australia. Our other Emerging markets also grew double digits driven by Mexico, Philippines and South Africa. On the R&D front, while Q1 has been light, we expect our spent to ramp up in Q2 and Q3 with the progress that we have in our pipeline. We expect R&D to be around INR 1,800 crores for fiscal year 25, with an increasing percentage of complex generics as we have planned over the last couple of years. We look forward to a very solid fiscal year 25 ahead with the momentum we have built in all our regions, the new product pipeline engine delivering at high gear and continued focus on the fundamentals from a efficiency and compliance standpoint. Our strategic growth drivers provide us with a clear line of sight to growth beyond the current fiscal year, both in terms of top line and EBITDA going ahead. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance. August 7, 2024",

We are in particular pleased with our EBITDA performance with 510 basis points improvement year-over-year and 50 basis points improvement sequentially, despite higher investments in R&D. We feel confident of maintaining our growth momentum in the coming quarters with EBITDA margins in the 22% to 23% range for the fiscal, based on our business momentum and continued focus on driving efficiencies. Our US Business performance was strong this quarter with volume-led growth in in-line products, and strong performance in our respiratory portfolio, offsetting additional competition in products like Suprep® and Doxycycline. With the recent successful launch of Mirabegron 50 milligram, and Pred Forte® with the CGT exclusivity, we feel confident of delivering close to double-digit growth in the US this fiscal. Also we have continued to improve our profitability in the US, led by better product mix and higher efficiencies in the base business. We are very optimistic of our long-term growth strategy in the US. So far, we have evolved our business to 40% complex generics, and we have an exciting pipeline with more than 20 respiratory products, and 40 injectable products in development that we believe will enable us to continue to drive the shift to 50% plus in the next couple of years. Coming to India, we reported strong growth of 19% year-over-year led by growth in our India formulations business and additional tenders in our Global November 8, 2024 Institutional Business. Our India Formulations business recorded growth of 10.9%, 40% ahead of the market. For H1, our growth was 30% ahead of the market, so very strong momentum in India. Volume growth in the quarter was a strong 3.5%. Im happy to report that all our key therapy areas Cardiac, Respiratory, Diabetes and GI grew ahead of the market. I would like to specifically call out our Diabetes portfolio which was challenged in the past due to loss of exclusivities on brands. Our Diabetes business now, grew 19% year-over-year against the category growth of 9% in the quarter. We feel confident on continuing to deliver above market growth in our India Formulations business backed by a strong portfolio of innovative and in-licensed products, and extensive reach through our 10,000 people sales force. Our non-US developed markets grew 20% year-over-year driven by strong growth in key markets like Canada, UK and Australia. Growth was contributed by both in-line products like Zaxine® in Canada, Luforbec® our Fostair® generic in the UK, as well as new product launches. We also witnessed healthy growth in our key Emerging markets like Mexico and South Africa during the quarter. On R&D, as planned, R&D as a percentage of sales has increased to 8.2% during the quarter. We successfully completed Phase 3 for our Ranibizumab biosimilar this quarter which paves the way for us to file the product in the US and EU this year. We expect R&D to be around INR 1,800 crores for fiscal year 25 with an increasing percentage of complex generics as planned, primarily in the respiratory as well as injectables platforms. From a compliance perspective, we have submitted our responses to the recent FDA audits at our Pune Biotech and Pithampur Unit-I facilities. We would like to reiterate that we are committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with US FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world. Before I hand it over to Ramesh, I would like to say that we remain very optimistic on our growth potential both in the short and medium term. Our strategic growth levers are well defined and backed by an exciting pipeline of products in our chosen markets and key therapy areas. We are committed to driving efficiency measures while leveraging our investments across all major geographies. We are confident on building on our momentum both in terms of top-line and profitability going ahead. With this, I will hand it over to Ramesh.",

And then we have couple of partnered products, Denosumab in Japan with a partner. We dont have plans to bring it into the other markets unless we find a partner. And then Etanercept in the US in 29.

In Europe, the potential of the DM indication is multiple times the NDM. We think it could be USD 100 million product in Europe, and then in the US based on pricing, it can be well beyond that. So, in Europe, likely we will launch first. But, the team is in the process of putting the plans together, especially with the addition of Klaus now, November 8, 2024 making sure we can leverage the opportunity across all the developed markets on a timely basis.",

      "content": "Good evening friends, I am very pleased to welcome you to our Q3 Financial year ’2025 earnings call. I have with me our Managing Director Nilesh, our CFO Ramesh and our head of Investor relations Ravi. We look forward to sharing with you our highlights for the quarter as well as outlook for the year ahead. We are very happy to report another quarter of strong performance across our key markets both on a sequential and YoY basis. This has been backed by continued improvement in margins and profitability. I would like to highlight that our margins are the highest we have achieved in the last 5 years, despite higher investments in R&D during the period. We feel confident of maintaining our growth momentum going ahead with margins in the range of 22%-23% in the current fiscal year. Our US business delivered strong QoQ and YoY growth this quarter with revenues at a five year high. This has been led by volume growth in inline products and contribution from new products like Mirabegron that helped us offset the anticipated competition in products like Albuterol and Suprep®. Our respiratory portfolio continued strong with higher market shares in most of the key products. We look forward to a strong close to the current fiscal year, as well as continued momentum in the year ahead. Apart from key products like Tolvaptan, we have an exciting portfolio of injectable products like Glucagon, Risperdal Consta, Liraglutide which we anticipate bringing to market next fiscal year that should help us deliver strong growth in the year . We continue to improve our profitability in the US, led by better product mix and higher efficiencies in the base business. We are very optimistic of our long term growth strategy in the US as it continues to evolve from a commoditized generic business to more complex portfolio of injectables, respiratory and biosimilars, to ultimately a portfolio of strategic specialty assets. We believe that our pipeline will enable us to continue to drive the shift to complex products to over 50% of our portfolio over the next couple of years. Coming to India, we reported growth of 11.9% YoY led by growth in India Formulations business and additional tenders in our Global Institutional business. Our India Formulation business recorded growth of 9.1% for the 9M this fiscal year against an IPM growth of 8.2%. While key therapies like Diabetes, Cardiac, GI grew ahead of the market and we also increased our chronic share, muted growth in the respiratory category affected our overall performance during the quarter. We are very pleased to strengthen our diabetes portfolio by acquiring the Huminsulin range of products from Eli Lilly February 12, 2025 and also 3 trademarks from Boehringer Ingelheim for the Indian market. We feel confident on continuing to deliver above market growth in our India Formulation business, backed by our strong portfolio of innovative medicines and in-licensed products and our extensive reach through 10,000 people sales force. Switching to R&D, our R&D as % to sales was at 7.7% during the quarter and 7.4% for the 9M. We successfully filed Ranibizumab in EU during the quarter and are looking forward to the US filing in the coming quarters. We have an exciting pipeline, with more than 20 respiratory products and 40 injectable products in development and plan to file more than 30 ANDAs in the next 2 years, of which more than 50% will be complex products. As previously guided, we expect R&D to be around INR 1,800 crores for fiscal year 25, which would mean a significant increase in our R&D spends in Q4. From a compliance perspective, we received the EIR from the USFDA for our Pithampur Unit-1 manufacturing facility with VAI classification during the quarter. So far this year, we have received EIRs for Aurangabad and Dabhasa and have successfully completed inspections at Somerset and Nagpur Injectable Facility with zero observations. We would like to reiterate that we are committed to ensure that all our sites are fully compliant with the USFDA and other regulatory agencies around the world. Before I hand it over to Ramesh, I would like to say that we remain optimistic to grow our business in the years ahead. Our R&D capabilities and pipeline are gaining momentum, be it our investments in various respiratory platforms like Ellipta and Respimat or the focus on complex platforms in injectables like iron colloids, peptides, 505 b(2)s and long acting Injectables and also our growing portfolio of biologics. We are also creating some unique differentiators like green propellant programs for our respiratory franchise. As I have mentioned earlier, we also continue to evolve our innovation pipeline to ramp up our specialty business in the years ahead. We believe our approach on the pipeline front and our commercial strategy will drive long term sustainable growth for the company and also build long term value for our shareholders. With this I will hand it over to Ramesh for a deeper analysis of our performance.",

      "content": "Actually, its a promising trend on the biosimilars front in the US in particular in the last 12 months, both from a regulatory perspective with the FDA easing the requirements on interchangeability, you dont need to do additional studies for interchangeability anymore. And with the trend on private labels from the large PBMs like with Caremark and Humira, what they did with the Sandoz, the Cordavis label that converted the majority of the market from Humira to the biosimilar, that is a promising trend on the market front. In the past, as we looked at it, both from a development perspective, we saw the biosimilars were fairly onerous, capital intensive, and then from a go-to- market standpoint you needed commercial infrastructure and both seem to start easing up at this point. So its a really positive trend. I mean we have a good number of products for the near term, so we continue to invest in those. As I mentioned, Ranibizumab was filed in EU this past quarter, will be filed in the US. So we have Pegfilgrastim that we still see as an opportunity, as we get the product approved. We have Ranibizumab, Aflibercept, and then Etanercept in 29 that comes into the market in the US where we should be one of three in the market and then we have other products like Certolizumab and Mepolizumab respiratory products as well that we are pursuing. So actually, it looks like the biosimilar market is starting to open up and, as it does, well continue to look at opportunities. As it opens up and on the one side the challenges come down, but the competition goes up. So our focus is very much going to be in limited competition products where were going to be in the first wave, where we can be one of two, one of three. That is the kind of focus that we will have from a portfolio standpoint. So it will be a fairly selective number of products that we will pursue. February 12, 2025",

      "content": "Thank you, Ravi. Well, its a real pleasure to meet all of you here today in person. I know we havent done a face-to-face meeting for a good number of years. The last time I recall we met, it was I think in 2022, when we were just coming out of COVID, had gone through a number of challenges that had impacted our performance. And from there, in 2022, with the efforts that we worked upon, I think about it, number one, execution of new product launches, in particular in the US, to turn around the US business, leveraging our complex generic portfolio to build Other Developed Markets, growing India and Other Emerging Markets on a consistent basis. At the same time, focus on cost optimization whether its footprint rationalization or broad efficiency measures, and third, our quality and compliance efforts that enabled us to work through our OAI sites, 3 sites in particular, have really enabled us to turn our business around over the last 3 years. We are very pleased that fiscal year ‘25 has been a stellar year for the organization where we have continued the momentum, the growth momentum, as well as continue to evolve our strategic growth drivers and capabilities to continue to grow in the future. So we look forward to sharing with you our performance thus far and our plans going forward. So before that, I will just start with where Lupin is today. When you look at our company globally, we are the 12th largest generic company by revenues. We had a great year with USD 2.7 billion in revenue and USD 625 million in EBITDA, delivered by a very strong group of Lupinytts. When you look at our presence across our key markets, we have a leadership position in all our key markets. Starting with the US, where we are the 3rd largest company by prescriptions dispensed. India, where we are the 8th largest, primarily organically. I mean there are companies that have done acquisitions that have gone above us but from an organic growth standpoint, we have consistently May 15, 2025 grown our India business. And other markets like Australia, where we are the 4th largest company on the generic front, and South Africa, where we are the 8th largest company on the generic front. So really a substantial position in all our critical markets, driven by a very strong pipeline of generics, branded drugs, as well as complex generics. If you look at our business globally, for this past year, its very well diversified. You look at the Developed Markets and the Emerging Markets. The US and Other Developed Markets are roughly 50%, India and Other Emerging markets are roughly 50%. And when you look at the nature of the business, the India and Emerging Market is primarily branded business. US, Other Developed Market is primarily generic business. So very well diversified business geographically. Very pleased with the progress we have made on the ESG front. So its been a stellar year for us, not only from a financial perspective, building on the growth momentum but also growing sustainably as an organization. So this is our current footprint around the world. In particular, on the manufacturing front, we have a very strong footprint that supports our generic business globally, with 15 manufacturing sites around the world, 4 in the Americas, 2 in the US in particular, that give us tremendous capability and flexibility to be able to manufacture more in the US If it made sense, based on the tariff considerations and also the economic incentives that the government puts in place, if its attractive, we will have the flexibility to manufacture more in the US Look at our R&D centres, seven R&D centres around the world, including 4 in the Americas again, 2 in the US, as well as in Mexico and Brazil, and then 1 in the Netherlands, the Nanomi long-acting injectable R&D centre in Nanomi. So tremendous capabilities on the R&D and manufacturing front to drive our growth going forward as an organization. You look at our manufacturing plants, in particular, for the US, we have 12 plants that serve the US market. Id say 11 right now because the Pune biotech facility is yet to be approved by the FDA, but have multiple manufacturing sites that are approved by the FDA, as well as other regulators that enable us to build our generic business. So if you look at our major pillars of growth, you saw our purpose statement that we take a lot of pride in. We put a lot of effort in crystallizing that statement and are very proud of catalysing treatments, both across innovative medicines as well as affordable medicines to serve the communities and the patients that we provide drugs to. When you look at our major pillars of our business, the US in particular has come a long way for the organization, evolving our portfolio from the simple products to complex generics, in particular on the inhalation front, very soon on the injectable front as well, fiscal year ‘26 is going to be a material year on the injectables front, and biosimilars, which is an opportunity that is emerging now for us. Theres been a lot of back and forth on the biosimilars front over the last couple of years, but given the change from a regulatory perspective, May 15, 2025 the FDA reducing the requirements for interchangeability studies, as well as the private label model appearing in the US, the US is emerging as an attractive biosimilars market, of course with selective portfolio choices. We also continue to operate our legacy business of oral solids, ophthalmic, dermatology, and leverage product opportunities that differentiate us, like you have seen Mirabegron, Tolvaptan that is going to be a material contributor in fiscal year ‘26. So the US is on a very strong foundation, a very strong trajectory from a growth perspective in the next couple of years. Other Developed Markets, especially Europe, Canada, Australia, leveraging our portfolio in the US, the platforms in the US, complex generics are the largest part of growth in Other Developed Markets and allow us to really build both on our capacities, manufacturing as well as R&D capabilities, to gain operating leverage across the globe. In India, we continue to focus on delivering growth above the market. The last 5 years, the last 10 years, we have consistently grown above the market. Wed like to grow 1.2, 1.3 times the market and we have done that in many years. The last couple of years, with the loss of exclusivity on-inlicensed products, the growth has been a little below that, but its still been above market growth over the last many years. Our strategy is both innovative products as well as a pipeline that we have built internally as well as licensed through partners, and acquisitions. You saw recently we acquired the insulin brand from Lilly, which enables us to really gain the end-to-end economics on the product. And we will continue to look at acquisition opportunities to bolster our portfolio in the India business. Simultaneously, we also are expanding our footprint. We have done pretty well in terms of sales force expansion over the last couple of years, and continue to focus on expanding our footprint as a business within India. Also, you have seen us getting into strategic adjacencies that enable us to go beyond the pill, beyond the prescription medicine, into diagnostics, digital, OTC products that enable us to bring a full solution to the patient as opposed to just the prescription. We are starting to see the benefits of the strategy. We are starting to see the impact of the strategy on our prescription business, and we will continue to evolve these areas to be able to both strategically contribute to our position in the marketplace as well as build value through these efforts. Other Emerging Markets, in particular South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Philippines, we have strong local businesses that are pretty self-sustaining. All of them tend to really run the business on a positive cash flow, on growing profitably, primarily through their own pipeline developed internally or in- licensed, but also, where possible, integrate with Lupins pipeline in particular in the key areas like respiratory, CNS, biologics as well. In the Emerging Markets we also have a strong position in institutional business with our TB Portfolio, which is the companys legacy business. I am very proud that we are continuing to maintain a leadership position in this segment. On the API front, we have built substantial scale, and its enabled us to really build a very strong reliability of supply on the generic side of the business. This has been a critical piece of discussion in the US conversations very May 15, 2025 recently, where the US would like to bring API manufacturing in the US if possible but we as an organization have more than 50% of our generic portfolio vertically integrated through our own APIs that enables us to really have a very strong cost position as well as reliability of supply that we have been able to leverage to ensure that we meet the market requirements on a consistent basis. We also have leveraged the API business and capabilities to build a CDMO business, as you saw. This past year, we have made significant progress there in terms of the teams and capabilities and we will continue to evolve our CDMO business based on these API capabilities to be able to build value with this vertical. So, multiple growth drivers in the organization, that give us the confidence of consistent growth going forward. So, when I look at the journey over the last 5 years, there are many areas to highlight. On the commercial front, the turnaround of the US business was a material event for us over the last couple of years that enabled us to get back to consistent growth and more importantly profitable growth for the organization, and evolve our EBITDA margins on a consistent basis over the last 10 to 12 quarters. On the complex generic front, we were the first Indian company to launch a DPI in the US We were very proud with Spiriva® to be able to get that approval in 2023 and launch it as a sole generic. We are still the only generic in the marketplace. It took us long, 5 years from filing to get FDA approval but its enabled us to build Respiratory as a major vertical for our business in the US When I look at our MDI and DPI business in the US, right now its one-third of our US portfolio from a revenue’s perspective. So a material contributor to our business in the US as well as globally and also differentiates us as an organization. In India, we have expanded our position with 11 new divisions, a field force up from, it was 5,000, I think, 5 years ago, to 10,000 plus at this point, so significant expansion that has enabled us to grow above the market growth rate in the country. If you look at our chronic share in India, so again, we are very proud of this accomplishment. Five years ago, the picture looked very different. Our chronic share was sub 60% Today, its 64% chronic, so more sustainable, more profitable business. When we compare ourselves with our peers, we are actually one of the best mix of chronic versus acute as an organization in India. We have continued to focus on commercial excellence in areas that we felt needed dedicated focus, like the trade generics business that we recently spun out into a wholly-owned subsidiary, with the idea of really focusing hard on driving that business given the growth of the trade generics business in India, and Lupin Manufacturing Solutions, which again as I mentioned in the previous slide, on the API front, allows us to leverage our capabilities on the API R&D and manufacturing to build a CDMO business. We have also had strategic acquisitions over the last 5 years. Xopenex® in the US enabled us to get into the brand side of the business. When Sunovion was looking to get out of the market, we thought it was a strategic opportunity for us to have a foot into the brand business on the respiratory front in particular. May 15, 2025 The product has grown since we acquired with very limited promotion efforts, so we are looking at how we can build further on this start. Medisol in France that enabled us to get into, we didnt have a presence in France until we acquired Medisol, which gave us a very nice injectables portfolio that enables us to build our internal pipeline on top of this to build a business in France. And Southern Cross in Australia that allowed us to almost double our business, has been a significant contributor to growth in the Australian market and has enabled us to get to that position of 4th largest generic in the Australian market. If you look at the material product launches over the last 5 years, Suprep® from Somerset, Albuterol from India, Spiriva® that I just mentioned, our first dry powder inhaler in the US, Mirabegron, material contributor in the last fiscal year and continues to be this fiscal year as well. In India, we were very pleased to launch differentiated products like Difizma and Vilfuro, unique novel respiratory products that enable us to differentiate our product offering with the pulmonologist. In Europe, Luforbec® which is a Fostair® generic has enabled us to really double our business in Europe, so significant contributor to growing our business in Europe that has done extremely well over the last 3 to 5 years. And NaMuscla®, our first orphan drug, our first brand in Europe has grown very nicely over the last 5 years as well. We are actually in the process of the second indication. We started with the NDM indication which is smaller indication. DM indication is much larger. We are going through a phase 3 study at present for the DM indication in Europe as well as the US that will enable us to maximize this brand globally. And lastly, Etanercept, which has been a material contributor to our business in Europe as well as other parts of the world, Japan, Southeast Asia, Latin America. We are very pleased with how things are evolving in the US and will determine how we commercialize this product in the US in the years ahead. 2029 is when the patent goes off in the US If you look at the impact on the financials, we have improved our gross margins from 64 %, 5 years ago to 69 %. Look at our EBITDA margins, gone from 16% to 24%. We are a zero-debt company at this point, have strong cash flows and have considerably improved our ROCE from the 10 % level to 20 %. So very pleased with the financial results of all of the efforts over the last many years. On the compliance front, we have made material strides, getting 3 of our sites, Pithampur, Goa, Somerset out of warning letters to a VAI status. I am confident if the FDA was to visit the 2 pending sites, Mandideep as well as Tarapur, our sites are ready to receive them. But we dont have any pending products from the sites, so they dont have any hurry to come in and inspect these sites. But I am confident in the near future we will get those sites cleared as well. The last couple of years, its not been quiet. We have had multiple inspections across all of our different facilities and we have sailed through each of them. So looking forward to continuing that strong trajectory going forward. You can see the impact of all of these efforts over the last 5 years. I just mentioned the financial results but as you can see from the chart, the last 3 years has May 15, 2025 been a really strong trajectory for us and has also reflected in the shareholder value that has built over the last few years. So for fiscal year ‘25, you have already seen the numbers, so I am not going to reiterate them. Its been a stellar year from a revenue growth standpoint, from a margin growth standpoint, from a net income standpoint. But we are very pleased that all our markets, all our regions, grew this past year. And the majority of them grew double-digit. If you look at India, it grew at 14%. North America grew at 16%. US per se grew at 17%. EMEA grew 22%, so a stellar year in EMEA. APAC grew 5%. LATAM grew 10% after a Mexico facility came back up last year. Its now back to the pre-closure levels. So very pleased with the growth there as well. The Rest Of World, along with our GIB business, the tuberculosis TB tender business grew 11%, and our API business grew 3%. So a stellar year for us as an organization. So I want to switch from there to a couple of the trends in our industry. As we are looking at the industry, certainly a lot happening in the US but also multiple other trends that pose both challenges as well as opportunities for us as an organization. If I look at the geopolitical situation, a lot of things happening around the globe that really put India in a very strong position, in particular as countries and regions are de-risking from China. The US in particular is very focused on de-risking from China, and India I think is very well positioned to leverage that opportunity on multiple fronts. Tariffs are certainly going to shape the trade relationships between countries. The US is every day, every week in the news about tariffs on China, tariffs on other countries, tariffs on India. We are hopeful that, based on the bilateral trade negotiation between India and the US, the importance of Indian pharma sector in the US, given 50% of the prescriptions in the US come from India, that we are going to be able to convince the stakeholders to have either zero tariff or limited tariff on drugs from India. Certainly theres been a statement from the Trump administration on that front in the last couple of weeks that sounded promising, so fingers crossed on that front. Theres a paradigm shift in the US healthcare industry with all of the changes the new administration has made, a number of areas that are impacted so far. Many healthcare programmes have been impacted. A lot of research funding has been impacted in the US DOGE has made material cuts across multiple areas. FDA has lost 20,000 people. Thankfully the reviewers are still there. I mean, they cut a lot of the policy folks but not the review branch that actively reviews and approves products. The Inflation Reduction Act, you know, the government is actively reviewing the pill penalty on IRA. As a number of you might know, the IRA allowed HHS to negotiate drug pricing for biologics 13 years after the product is approved, while on small molecules its 9 years after product is approved, which was considered really a discrimination against small molecules. And that is under active review at this point, so we expect that it could land in the same place as biologics. You have heard in the last couple of days, MFN, you know, the executive order from the Trump administration linking the pricing in the US to Most Favored Nation pricing across Developed Markets in particular. We are going to see how this evolves. I think a lot of analysts are saying this is more bark than bite. At this point, you know, a number of big pharma companies have made commitments to invest May 15, 2025 in the US and very likely will renegotiate or backtrack those commitments if the government is going to peg pricing to overseas markets. We know that the US market actually funds for majority of the innovation in our industry, so really reducing pricing in the US is going to have a significant impact on the innovation front in the pharmaceutical industry. Theres growing talk about onshoring manufacturing in the US As I mentioned, this is likely going to be very closely linked with what the administration does on the MFN front, also very closely linked to what happens on tariffs, if there are material tariffs in place and theres an economic incentive to manufacture locally that makes products more viable. Certainly there will be an opportunity to expand manufacturing in the US. Switching to India, the pharma industry in India is poised to grow, double in the next 5 years, and this is not just in India, but also exports from India outside of the country. So its expectation of the revenues of the entire industry out of India is expected to double over the next 5 years. This would be fuelled a good part by the growth in the middle class, you know, thats expected to be 170 million people by 2030 and also very pleased that the government is now supporting ‘Develop in India’ in the new R&D scheme, the research scheme, incentive scheme that the government has talked about putting in place. Just like the production link scheme, PLI scheme, that has really benefited the industry in the last 5 years, we expect that this will certainly encourage more innovation in India and was much needed for the country. The India opportunities pivoting from pharma alone to overall healthcare, we talked a little bit about this in our context and patient-centric adjacencies like diagnostics, digital health, consumer health is gaining momentum. So the full solution for patients and physicians is gaining momentum in India. On the generic side of the business for the Developed Markets, there certainly is a move towards complex generics, as well as specialty. We see multiple companies moving in that direction, both on the complex generic front as well as the 505(b)(2), as well as innovation front., On the complex generics front, we have executed in multiple areas, inhalation in particular, but also on the specialty, 505(b)(2) front we have active portfolio together, pipeline together of both transformative opportunities as well as incremental innovation that will help us differentiate our portfolio in countries like the US as well as Other Developed Markets. We have seen over the last couple of years’ blockbuster drug classes emerge like the GLP-1s, diabetes, obesity class that is set to grow to USD 100 billion over the next 5 years. So certainly a material opportunity that has emerged in the marketplace. And as some of these products go off patent, like Semaglutide in particular goes off patent in March of next year in a handful of countries, it will open the market for further expansion on this class of drugs. Likewise, theres also an emergence on the biologics front. In India in particular, we are seeing emergence of biologics in particular in areas like immunology and oncology that is set to grow very nicely. Lastly, the rising impact of AI across industries and in pharma as well. On the brand side of the industry, theres certainly a very strong focus on drug May 15, 2025 development front through AI, delivering efficiency, from a timing as well as cost perspective. On the generic side of the business as well, there are multiple areas where we have potential gains here, from an efficiency standpoint, commercial execution standpoint, operation standpoint, cost optimization as well as quality perspective - that our industry is going to leverage. So a lot going on across the globe in our industry. So that brings me to our strategic areas of focus as an organization, looking at all of these trends, the areas that we have prioritized for our organization. Number one is to sustain our growth in our 2 major regions, India as well as the US. And based on the portfolio we have, based on the investments that we plan to make, we are confident of continuing to grow in both regions in the foreseeable future. Second is expanding our inhalation business. We have established a very strong position on the respiratory front. Today, if I look at our global turnover, 25% or so is on the respiratory side. We were always very strong in India, but over the last 5 years we have built a significant presence in the US, Europe and emerging in other parts of the world like Canada, Australia on the respiratory front. So we continue to build on this pillar, as well as innovate. I mean, there is a material move in particular in countries like Europe to move towards green propellants on the metered-dose inhalers and we believe we are at the forefront with this. Our R&D teams, our manufacturing teams have looked at our evolution from a pipeline perspective on the green propellant side, both for India as well as developed markets like US, Europe and other parts of the world. Third, delivering on our new product launches “on time and on budget” is a major part of our focus. Its been a substantial success for us over the last 3 years. Our team has come a long way in ensuring that the products that we target, we deliver them in time. And thats how youve seen products like Mirabegron, products like Tolvaptan, products like Spiriva® come to market in time and theres a very strong focus in the organization to deliver our new product launches. Number four is establishing a Speciality business. I mean, a number of you know, we have had a legacy speciality business in the US. We actually started the US business on the speciality front, on the paediatrics side. Then over the years, we went into the womens health side of the business, which we had some success with and got out when we saw challenges 3-4 years ago, when we went through the downturn. We are refocusing our efforts on building the speciality side of the business, both with acquisitions as well as internal pipeline, especially the 505(b)(2) pipeline that we are developing in-house. Fifth is establishing injectables and biosimilars as a growth driver for the future. I mean, we have capabilities across both in R&D and manufacturing, as you know. And this year in particular, were going to see a material inflection on the injectables front with products like Glucagon, products like Liraglutide, Risperdal Consta® from Nanomi coming to market. And with the emerging biologics opportunities with the FDA regulations easing up, as well as the private label business emerging in the US, we expect biosimilars to be May 15, 2025 a material growth driver going forward. Of course, as barriers reduce, the competition tends to increase. So we are very selective with our portfolio here to ensure that we are either in the first wave or we are one of a few players that will enable us to get a solid return on our investment with biologics, as well as grow the business on a sustainable basis. Sixth is establishing a novel product pipeline. I mentioned the 505(b)(2) pipeline that we are developing internally on our long-acting injectable platform, on our respiratory platform, some oral solids as well, that will help us build both our speciality business and in some cases also help us build a hospital business in the US in particular. Then building scale across other developed generic markets. So we believe that the platforms that we have in place and the pipeline that we have in place whether its on the respiratory front, biologics front, or the injectables front, has tremendous opportunities outside of the US, in particular in Europe, Canada, as well as Australia-like countries and theres a tremendous opportunity for us to gain operating leverage from these platforms across the global generics market, especially in the Developed Markets. So very focused on growing our European business and Other Developed Markets at a faster pace through these strengths that we have established. And lastly, Id say that continued focus on the cost position across our network. The bulk of our business is still generics, and cost optimization has to be a consistent effort to drive profitability on the generic side of the business. Theres still tremendous opportunities. As much as we have gained a lot of efficiencies over the last 5 years, theres still a lot of opportunities that we have on the operational front, on the supply chain front, on the quality front, to be able to continue to improve our cost position as an organization. All of this is enabled by, number one, our focus in quality and compliance. We have an aspiration to be best in class in compliance. We were best in class 10 years ago, and theres no reason why we cant get to this goal in the next few years. We are exploring areas that we can leverage digital and AI to get more efficient, to get more creative as an organization. Its a big lever that is yet to unfold, yet to really conclude what areas make sense for us to double down. But we have embarked on 5 or 6 material areas where we believe we can make a material difference through AI as well as digital. And last and most importantly is our people’s strategy. I mean, all of what you have seen so far has been delivered by a very strong, committed team, and we continue to work on our team both developing our people internally as well as bringing in capabilities from the outside to compliment and drive growth going forward along with our internal team. So very strong areas of growth that we have identified for ourselves. Were very focused on each of these areas and are confident that we will continue to grow our business on a consistent basis in the years to come ahead. So with that, I will hand it over to Nilesh to walk us through a deeper review of the business.",

      "content": "Thank you, Vinita. First of all, thank you for coming today. We used to always love doing this investor meet in person and COVID derailed it and then we did May 15, 2025 it in 2022. Then we didnt do it for a couple of years after. We certainly hope to do this regularly. We just think its a wonderful opportunity to engage with you today. Vinita talked about people. I will just quickly introduce some of our people. Ranjana, our Head of Quality. Rakesh, our CIO. Christoph, our Head of Tech Ops. Rajiv, our head of India region. Yash, our HR head. Moving to the next table, Tommaso, Vinitas Chief of Staff. Saurabh, from our India region, the power behind Rajiv. Sumita, Head of Business Development for India. Mohan, in charge of taxes. Amit, our Company Secretary. Robin, our finance team. Suresh, from our finance group. And then last of all, Ravi. Im missing out a few in the back but I think this is an opportunity for you to see some of the power behind Lupin as well. So on the business side, I think the biggest change which has happened is the US business, where we were in this slump and then we have grown the US from a net sales perspective back up to the USD 900-plus million, USD 925 million, year-on-year growth of 13%. That is obviously one of the biggest moves that we have had in the Lupin numbers. As you know, we have been number three in the US in terms of generic market share, 4.9% market share. Were very proud of the position that we have and especially at times like today when Indias role is being questioned, when tariffs are coming in question, I think a very important lever in this all is the market share that we have. We are very proud of the market share that we have in the US And you have seen this before, but in terms of the number of products, about 138 products in the market, 105 of them were in the top three, 45 were number one. We have more than a hundred products pending in the pipeline, addressing a market size of close to USD 150 billion. And you know the recent NPLs, Mirabegron, Spiriva®, Pred Forte®, and of course earlier this week, Tolvaptan. So obviously on a very, very good trot from a launch perspective. As Vinita mentioned, the focus is on cost efficiency and optimization. And then obviously we want to build on that base business that we have of specialty. We have Xopenex® and NaMuscla® that we have but you know, this was legacy for us. We started with Suprep® in the US So we certainly want to build out that specialty. But if you really see what thats done, I mean, if you look at the journey in the last five years, , USD 800 million went to USD 720 million, USD 738 million, USD 632 million. I mean, that obviously was a very disruptive time for Lupins P&L. And if you see the last three years, you see that consistent 21% growth in the business. Were very proud of the way that we have turned this around. And obviously our collective goal is to sustain this growth that we have had and build on this business. Obviously, thats come from the move to complex generics. So if you see in FY25, complex generics is about 30% of our revenues. If you look at the next five years, that complex generics will move to 49% of revenues. And then obviously the key growth drivers for the generics business remains NPLs, more than 100 plus NPLs. And 65% of revenues that we will get will come from complex generics. Over 60 filings in the next five years, focused highly on First to File, on Para 4 products. And then clearly in the US, the key imperative would, other than the move getting deeper into complex generics, would be to build on specialty, both through our own portfolio but through acquisitions and alliances as well. May 15, 2025 On our second key market, India, were ranked number eight. Were not happy at all with this rank. I think we have to be in the top five but currently number eight. Good growth rate in the last 10 years, 12%, 1.2 times the market growth rate, 3.4% market share, our key therapy areas, as you know, are Diabetes, Cardiovascular and Respiratory. GI is actually the fourth largest therapy area for us. Doing well in Diabetes and Cardio. Respiratory has been extremely sluggish in the last two years. I think this will be the year that it will bounce back as well. GI, again, growing very strong, double digit. Vinita mentioned the sales force size, but total more than 10,000 people across the sales team. Clearly, our focus is on building the innovation pipeline for India and part of that is going to come from very strong in-licensing as well. So if you see the India business and just double-clicking on that a little bit, if you split it between the IL, the in-license and the non-IL, you will see that the in-license portfolio actually helped us grow in the past., Even in 2021-22, you see the growth coming from the darker green bar, which is in-license portfolio. The last three years, that portfolio has been challenged. De-growth in FY23 of 13% in that portfolio, minus 1% and minus 12% in FY24 & FY25 respectively and despite that minus 12% growth, we have grown at 8.4%, versus the market growth of 8% in FY25. The loss of exclusivity, the erosion on the in-license part has largely played out and therefore from FY26, we see getting back on the double-digit growth across the portfolio and continuing double-digit growth going forward. The focus, as Vinita mentioned, is on chronic. If you look at the current portfolio, 64% of sales come from chronic. If you see by FY30, itll actually move to 70%, 69% - 70%. So we actually will get even deeper onto the chronic side. Number two in Respiratory, number three in Diabetes, number three in Cardiac as well. The growth going forward, first of all, the aspiration is to grow at 1.2 to 1.3 times the market. Part of that is its going to come from enhanced reach, over 2,000 representatives to be added in the next four, five years. Basically programmatically, we want to add the 400-500 representatives every year. A scientific approach, when were reaching out to doctors and the community including the patients that we would work with as well. NPLs, new product launches, is going to be a key growth driver, over 80 products in our portfolio for the next five years. Focus will remain on chronic therapy areas. Obviously, as a large cardiac and diabetes player, GLP-1s is going to be an important part of that play. But also beyond that, getting deeper into GI, building that as the fourth large therapy area for us, getting into oncology, we are there but we are fledgling in our presence. So oncology, CNS, Vitamins, scaling up in these areas as well, as the next three areas that will come into our India region. Obviously, partnering as the market is changing with e-commerce, with organized retail, with the institutional business as well. We have evolved organization structure to meet with that. . Before that, the extra urban. This is a part of the market that we feel is very exciting. I think really going into tier two, tier three, we started with the pilot. The pilot was successful. We are now scaling up, and thats where the major addition in sales force is happening this year. Obviously, we would look at May 15, 2025 opportunities in India. There are few and far between but we want to be there. We have acquired a few, but not of scale. I think that is certainly an organization priority and then moving closer to physicians, closer to patients through our adjacencies as well. Other Developed Markets, I think Europe is, you know, we have always talked about the fact that we built India and the US and in that neglected Europe, we are certainly focused on Europe at this point of time. Its grown to a reasonable scale, USD 195 million in the last fiscal, 14% growth rate in the last five years. Obviously, products like NaMuscla®, the respiratory portfolio is driving the business in the Europe including Etanercept Biosimilar. We are in a few regions and the others are through Pan-European partnerships. So nice reach across Europe but to be scaled. If you look at the next five years, 50 plus NPLs in Europe, 55% of revenues will actually come from complex generics and obviously expand into other markets with our own onshore presence within Europe. Canada, again, a nice little business, USD 47 million sales, FY25, 18% CAGR for the last five years and 60% of the business coming from specialty. And if you look again, going forward, complex generics will drive that portfolio, a lot of it led by inhalation. And lastly, on the Other Developed Markets, Australia, USD 78 million sales. Were ranked number four in the Australian generic market, 20% CAGR in the last five years, growth led by both our own business but our partnered business within Australia as well. The focus is on new product launches there, including biosimilars and were expanding into the New Zealand market as well. To the next bucket, Other Emerging Markets, South Africa, USD 83 million, number one rank in cardiovascular, the eight largest generic company in South Africa. Focus again, remains new product launches. There as a large cardiac player to move into GLP-1s as well, participating in ARV tenders as well. Philippines, close to USD 40 million in sales. We are number two ranked in our reference market in that, again, a very wide portfolio of products. Youll see GLP-1s everywhere but 50-plus launches including biosimilars planned for the Philippines. Mexico, about USD 50 million. Net sales, we are number three, ranked as an ophthalmic player. 70% of our revenues come from ophthalmics and more than 20 products lined up for launch including NaMuscla®. Brazil, USD 42 million, number three rank in their reference market. 40% of our portfolio in Brazil is OTC. Were looking at point-of-sales expansion and we are looking at new product launches across multiple therapy areas in Brazil. May 15, 2025 Lastly, our GIB business actually had one of the best CAGR’s across our businesses, 20% in the last five years. Growth obviously led by scaling up TB, including prevention of tuberculosis with products like Rifapentine and building out the HIV portfolio as well. So the adjacencies, really quickly, we dont talk that much about those. On Lupin Diagnostics, 44% year-on-year revenue growth. We have been amongst our peers fastest to get to INR 100 crores. All our labs are approved by NABL, and that was a key part because we want to be a trusted partner on the diagnostic side. That is our differentiation in this area. The target is to be EBITDA positive in FY27. Pretty good reach across most cities. Were not in North India. Other than that, were actually across most geographies in India. Lupin Life is our OTC business, INR 150 crores, big plans to grow. The aspiration is to well more than double this in the next three to four years. A lot of reach being expanded at this point of time. We have two anchor products. There are two more products that were launching as well. So small business today but certainly another anchor to growth in India. Our digital health, we have talked about this a little bit but this has been a challenging part of the business for us because youre actually changing physician and patient behaviour. So its been slow. I think its getting to that inflection point at this point. The goal there is to be the partner of choice for post-discharge care of cardiac patients. We have our first product. Theres a follow-on product. The focus here is connected devices, AI-powered apps, experienced healthcare professionals backing it up. If somebody has a cardiac event, we want to be the partner of choice post-discharge. Lupin Life Sciences is our trade generics business. We launched this last year, obviously building on the equity of the Lupin brand and quality products from Lupin. The focus is primarily on tier two and tier three towns and areas where were currently under-prescribed and we are building a lot of on-the-ground presence with more than 400 people in that field force, which is different from the model which many other people do it. The idea there is really to emerge as a strong player in this space. And the last of the adjacencies, Lupin Manufacturing Solutions, our CDMO business. We have a full Global team, all the structures in place. I think we have taken a lot of effort to put the team together in the course of the last year. We have this legacy of developing complex products including fermentation products. And we have large-scale manufacturing from a CGMP perspective as well. And we have an R&D center in Pune. That really positions us to be able to work on innovation pipeline but also to carve out our own differentiation within the space. And part of that is going to be in areas like peptides or in ADCs. On the R&D and the portfolio, its been over 20 years. And we started with the First to Files. Right now, were pursuing 30-plus First to Files, as I mentioned. Then we moved into inhalation. We really have that franchise across the inhalation space. So MDIs, DPIs, SMIs even. So obviously getting May 15, 2025 deep into inhalation across the US, India, across Europe as well, to expand to other geographies as well. Building that presence next on injectables, on the complex injectables in particular, depo injections, peptides, liposomal products as well. We will talk a little bit more of our pipeline in the next few slides. Biosimilars, where we built a nice commercial presence ex-US but the intention of course is to be meaningful in the US on that as well. And what we have is absolutely world- class R&D and manufacturing capabilities and the ability to do a pretty wide array of products. And the last on the product development and capability building is obviously Specialty. Building out the 505(B)(2), building out the value-added medicines, whether its long-acting injectables, oral solids, IUDs implants, green propellants as well. So you see a wide array of capabilities that we’ve built over the years. And what its really done is deliver on the business. So if you see the US, FY20 complex generics was 2% of the business, grew to 34% in FY25. And if you see again the next five years, will grow to 55% of the business in the US. In Europe, , 9% was the composition of complex platforms in FY20, 55% at this point of time and growing to two-thirds of the business by FY30. I wont talk through the entire portfolio that has driven this but obviously we have had some nice launches. We had Etanercept. We obviously had Albuterol in the US in 2020. Luforbec® that we launched in Europe became a big anchor product. Then obviously came products like Tiotropium and theres a whole slew of products, especially on the inhalation side, which have helped deliver this. If you look at the upcoming launches and we were cognizant that we have obviously had a good last year. We have a good FY26 as well. Whats happening in FY27? Its actually a good portfolio coming in FY27 as well. Three products that we intend to launch on the inhalation side, a couple of products on the injectable side, biosimilars, two products that will come to market and a couple of important oral solids that will come out as well and our first specialty product in FY27. Before that in FY26, you see injectables picking up. You see Glucagon, you see Liraglutide, you see Risperidone long-acting, that we hope to launch this year. Etanercept in Australia, obviously Tolvaptan, which we have launched and another oral solution, that we will launch, which will be a key product as well. This is on the back of good number of products in the market. So again, , in inhalation, 12 products in the market across geographies, injectable, over 10 products, biosimilars, obviously Etanercept only at this point of time and the oral solids, obviously well over 300 products over time. And you see the products in the pipeline, and inhalation, thats where we are all in, 30 products in the pipeline. Injectable, another 30 products that are in that pipeline as well. Biosimilars, we have over 10 products in the pipeline. And obviously all the other dosage forms kind of adds up in the number as well. If you look further, if you look at FY28, you see more of that inhalation, you see injectables, you see the biosimilars coming to market as well. And in FY29, you see a whole slew of inhalation products that will come to market and thats I think, when we will get steady on the injectable side as well. So we May 15, 2025 can talk more about this but if you see the pie chart at the bottom, I think those are the revenues of new product launches that will come from Complex Generics. So if you see FY26, obviously products like Tolvaptan are contributing significantly to the new product revenues. But FY27, you see a very large portion, 55% coming from Complex Generics. Similar in FY28, 54%, even higher. FY29, 61% coming from Complex Generics and even higher thereafter with 62% revenues coming from Complex Generics in FY30. Quickly on quality, you know, we have color-coded this a little differently because we wanted to add the biotech facility which is pending. Like we said, we have got two sites which have been in a non-satisfactory state of compliance. Obviously biotech, were pending approval from the US as well. So we have put that into the list. Other than that, obviously the rest of the facilities have been inspected regularly and have good standing. As you would see over the years, I think FY20 was obviously the worst where we had five sites which were not in a satisfactory state of compliance. Now down to two. We have had a bunch of inspections. EIR’s from about five sites that have been received in the last year. Our goal is, one, to be best in class. Two, to target all sites to be ready at any point of time for an inspection. Were looking at really the supply chain. So its not just us. What happens before us with KSM’s or API’s that we would buy? So thats part of the ensuring quality. And the other part is on training. Can we really use training as a differentiator? Focusing a lot more on training than what we did in the past. And lastly, you know, we talked about Christoph. We have set this Global Tech Ops function. Very good results over the last few years on this. If you look at from a customer focus perspective, our OTIF levels are at 100%.. Even for India, 98%. Lowest ever backorder, lowest ever FTS. And our focus is on de- risking. Whether its from China or whether its other single source entities, we are working to build agility into the system so that our lead times just keep getting better and better. Thats our focus. I think theres a lot more that we would want to do on that customer focus path. On the cost leadership, we have talked in the past. USD 50 million were delivered last year through AVDs, through freight optimization, yield improvement and the like. Were optimizing our global footprint. Our air ocean ratio is down to an all-time low. Basically, its only new product launches that we would send by air. Everything else pretty much goes by ocean. Again, the supply chain is really, really working, including our manufacturing, procurement and the like. And the next anchor on this is technology leadership, whether it is AI or digital transformation. We have Kinaxis, which enables the entire organization globally. We have several of our sites which are fully paperless. And on the backbone of that, you can imagine what you can do with AI today. And now were investing a lot more into automation and the like, continuous flow reactors. We started with one or two use cases. Now theres three or four cases that we are considering. Robotics that were introducing into some of our plants as well. So very exciting time from a manufacturing perspective. I will hand over to Ramesh now. May 15, 2025",

I think the fact that we are a large generic company as well I don’t see that as a challenge at least in none of the conversations that we have had so far. This started with a fact that we were overinvested in API and we had additional capacity which was available as well. But I think you know with some of the China rhetoric, with some of the alternatives that people have been seeking as well I think it has become a large opportunity. It is also an opportunity that we can do at scale. I think there is multiple reasons why we are excited and we need to build. Once we have got numbers we will present those numbers but I don’t see anything coming as a challenge at this point of time. We have to build capability though. I think our key goal was commercial capability and project management. It is just operates at a very different level versus a generic company in that. So, our goal has been to build that and the team that we May 15, 2025 have built is all from the CRDMO space. So, optimistic but I think we will put our heads down, work for two years and then talk about good numbers.",

      "content": "It has been quite an evolution. The strategy has been evolving on the biosimilars front just given the market evolution. When you look at the changes that have taken place in the US. It is really creating opportunity for older products as well for us. For example, Pegfilgrastim it’s a very old product, multiple players in the marketplace. But as we have had conversations over the last year with the customer base the fact that we will come in with a new ASP that’s attractive for providers makes it a very attractive opportunity. So, we really see value in bringing Pegfilgrastim to market. Whether we do it ourselves or we do it with a partner is a question mark.. We have both options available to us. So, when you look at the other products, if you start looking at the first product that we had invested in was Etanercept - Enbrel®, and the idea with Enbrel® was global, we wanted to get into the US market, European market, everywhere we can and theres a submarine pattern that appeared in the US that held the product back until 2029. But we launched in Europe through Viatris, now Biocon, as well as other parts of the world through other partners. In the US we have the ability to bring the product into the market ourselves in s fiscal year 30. It will be a material opportunity for us because we likely will still be one of four in the marketplace. So, for us so far it has been a learning on the biosimilars front. We have tried to mitigate the risks through partnerships, partnerships on the development cost, partnerships on commercialization. In the last 12 months with the changes in the US we really see an opportunity of going direct into the market with biosimilars. Particularly for products like Pegfilgrastim May 15, 2025 certainly there is an opportunity. But also for the Ophthalmic products - the two products that we have on the Ophthalmic front, Ranibizumab and Aflibercept. we have the relationships with Ophthalmic distributors right now. AmerisourceBergen which is now Cencora is 70% of the ophthalmic market, they visit 70% of the ophthalmic clinics. So, we have the relationships in place to be able to enter that market if we get approval in time and can launch the product. Having said that going forward now given the barriers are reducing it becomes like a complex generic play for us. So, the focus is on products where the number of competitors are limited or where we can be one of few in the market place.",
