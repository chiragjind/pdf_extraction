So on that level I think it’s a lot more about simplifying and we are working with outside consultants on that, we are working with pwc, we are also working with Lachman on this, we are also working on the culture fronts McKinsey and -- on that but all of this is not particularly big spend, in fact, some of those variations will cost more than some of this. What we are trying to do in the longer term is for example we want to be able to add a software layer so that any out of spec anything gets automatically highlighted to management and some of these systems don’t exist, those will probably be more expensive but these are going to be pilots and we are working with certain partners to actually develop Lupin Limited May 19, 2016 this as a platform for us. So I don’t really see a very meaningful increase in spends on this count.",

Now, I imagine that Glumetza was launched sometime towards the end of the quarter, Albuterol also November 5, 2020 came in towards the end of August/1st week of September. So, isnt it, the way it functions is that you might have shipped inventories, say for a couple of months, or one month, or even three months for that matter, and the numbers could have been a bit better than what have been recorded or the inventories that have been shipped for Albuterol or for Metformin are pretty much taken care of them the month in which they have been launched.",

Secondly, on the US, if I heard that correct, youre expecting a ramp up more so from Q4 on Albuterol not the current quarter when its really in a sweet spot given Perrigo’s withdrawal. So, what is the key bottleneck in terms of ramping up? Is it, the compound I think you had enough time to prepare that, is it the bottling or what really goes into that it takes time and also seen from your you know, the other competitor Cipla also took time? So, is it product related? Or is it like other vendor related? If you could help us and thats why you think Q4 would be more appropriate in terms of ramping up. November 5, 2020",

It doesnt show up in share as of yet, because share will lag the market supplies, but it will show up as we get additional new data from IQVIA.

So sir, just wanted to understand, partly on the cost containment measures, in last quarter, we outlined that we are going to save around INR 500 crores to INR 700 crores in the ensuing years. However, whatever we have detailed out in terms of the things which we are working out to contain the cost, doesnt seem to add up to save around INR 500 crores, INR 700 crores. So, what is the exact reason? Because just changing the vendor or something will not lead to a INR 500 crores of savings. So, what exactly we are doing to do that, achieve that number?",

We achieved a lot of success in at least three or four of them, whilst two others we were kind of stymied because the volumes dropped and there was write-offs among others. So overall, I would say that its mixed results. So at least about 50% to 60% has been achieved, but where February 10, 2023 we have not achieved also just significantly alters the balance. So still working on those. And its not as it will never get achieved. It will get achieved. Its only a question of time and that would actually kind of round up the full complement.",

Most of the suppliers weve not worked with, or weve had mitigation plans in place, as these issues may have arisen as well. We have a pretty robust process of vendor management in place, so not impacted.

      "content": "I also wanted to clarify something, there’s so much of questions around the PLI and the like as well. The scheme provides for INR 1,000 crores over a period of five years, as all of us know this, so that actually roughly means about INR 200 crores. But it also actually provides for an exception, where you could actually take a quantum a little more during the course of one particular year. It’s an exception really to the framework. And we’ve taken advantage of this, this year because the fact that there’s a surge in terms of exports and the like. And obviously, money into the kitty much faster is always better for us. And that’s the reason why you would find a higher quantum of PLI money is coming in this year, but doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to be the same quantum spread over the next several years.",
